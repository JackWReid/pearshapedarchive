During Laura Marling’s student press conference, which PearShaped attended this week, she devoted a lot of time to talk about her literary influences:

> “I used to read a lot of fiction but I don’t any more. I read a lot of poetry. Where Gothic or Romantic literature used to play quite a big part in my vocabulary of emotional experience, now that I have my own emotional experiences, I like delving into poetry more than fantasy fiction.”

Here’s a list of all the writers and books that she mentioned and recommended.

Perhaps, by reading what she’s reading, you can gain a fresh and more nuanced insight into the work and mind of one of the most thoughtful and intelligent singer-songwriters today.

**1\. Selected Poems — Rainer Maria Rilke**

“My favourite poet is Rainer Maria Rilke, who was a bit of a hopeless romantic. He’s actually the main reason I got to writing this record \[Semper Femina\] in some ways, because I was research his life for a libretto for an opera. He was dressed as a girl until he was 8, which had quite a profound effect on his relationship to women, and made him somewhat like an obsessive woman-fancier. It was his misguided perception of femininity that led me to investigate more about that.”

**2\. Lou Von Salomé: A Biography of the Woman who Inspired Freud, Nietzsche and Rilke**

“I can’t recommend Lou Salome enough. She was a literary mentor for a lot of people. Any biography of hers that you can get your hands on would be of great benefit to your life, I’m sure.”

**3\. The Diaries of Anaïs Nin**

![3](http://pearshapedexeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3-181x300.png)Anais Nin: essayist, and criminally overlooked feminist icon. She wrote frankly and radically about sex, psychology, and how women could thrive in a male dominated world. 

**4\. We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live: Collected Nonfiction**

![4](http://pearshapedexeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-185x300.png)The essayist Joan Didion is known for her witty and clear style, but mostly for her sharp eye for acute and devastating insights.

**5\. The Rebel Angels — Robertson Davies**

![5](http://pearshapedexeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/5-194x300.png)This book inspired Laura for how it shows that forgotten cultures and mysticism have urgent messages to teach us today.

**6\. Women Who Run With the Wolves: Contacting the Power of the Wild Woman — Clarissa Pinkola Estes**

![6](http://pearshapedexeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/6-190x300.png)

By exploring myths, folklore, and fairy tales, this book revitalises the concept of the ‘wild woman’ — “the wise and ageless presence in the female psyche that gives women their creativity, energy and power.”
