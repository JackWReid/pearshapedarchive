Brought up on the thriving underground drum and bass scene of 1990s Bristol, and having spent years cultivating a unique and cross-genre style, itâ€™s not hard to understand why DJ/producer Hugh Pescod, better known by his alias Redlight, has settled himself deep within the UK dance music arena.

Spending much of the noughties cultivating his style with releases under the pseudonym DJ Clipz; in 2009 Pescod took on the mantle of Redlight and set up his own label, Lobster Boy. Following his reinvention, Pescod has gone from strength to strength, thriving under the freedom his own label has provided. Collaborating with the likes of Ms. Dyanamite and Raekwon (of Wu-Tang Clan fame), as well as remixing artists such as Mary J Blige and Maverick Sabre, has seen Redlight rise quickly through the ranks. His 2012 hit Lost in Your Love, with its catchy synth-house beats and dubstep undertones, shot straight to number 5 in the UK singles charts and successfully rubber-stamped all his credentials.

Since then Redlight has released a string of critically acclaimed singles and mixes, whilst continuing to develop his highly original DJ sets. Combining house with flavours of techno, jungle and some spicy DnB thrown in, his set on the 12th November at Move (formerly Cellar Door) is not one to be missed.
