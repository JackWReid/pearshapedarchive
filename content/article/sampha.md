Unless you have been living under a rock you will have heard of Sampha Sissey, the man of the hour. London based singer, songwriter and producer Sampha may have just released his debut album in 2017, but he has been a baller in the music industry since 2010. He released his first EP in 2010, featured in Jessie Wares' hypnotic Valentine in 2011 and made a name for himself in the UK's underground music scene by featuring as a guest vocalist on SBKRT's tracks. However, it wasn't until his 2013 EP, Dual, that Sampha was recognised by critics for his raw talent and ability to bare his soul in his songs. Not long after, Sampha scored his biggest break with not one but two features (and productions) on Drake's now double platinum album, Nothing Was The Same.

After critical acclaims about his contributions to Drake's album, the pressure of the perfect debut album mounted on Sampha but he put the worries of his fans to rest with the beautiful masterpiece, Process. The release of the album could not have been timed better, especially after his successful work in 2016 with the biggest names in the music industry- Beyonce, Frank Ocean, Kanye West and Solange Knowles.

Sampha's music represents the perfect marriage of electronic and soul music. It's overwhelming and lethal really, this combination of smooth beats and the voice of an angel. The transparency of Sampha's voice is a jarring contrast to the abstract nature of his lyrics, and never fails to induce a torrent of emotions in me. All of his songs possess a haunting quality that lingers hours after you've heard them.

Riding off the success of his debut album, Process, Sampha begins his UK and Europe tour in March. If you feel brave enough to witness the human embodiment of melancholy put up an exquisite performance, head over to the O2 Academy in Bristol on the 28th of March.
