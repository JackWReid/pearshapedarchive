Describing themselves somewhat proudly as a “nose-bleed on the ears”, pugnacious post-punk pedlars IDLES are bringing their raucous, confident, slightly intimidating but highly energetic sound to The Fleece in Bristol on the 8th March.

IDLES have come a long way since their humble origins in the subterranean depths of Bristol’s underground scene, way back in 2010. From playing their “sometimes unlistenable” music (again, a proud self-description) in sweaty clubs to airplay and adoration from Radio 1 Introducing, and then to supporting the Maccabees in their farewell London shows, IDLES’ rise is meteoric and awe-inspiring. With two EPs under their belt - Welcome in 2012 and MEAT in 2016 - their debut full-length, Brutalism, is dropping on the 10th of March, and promises to match with its name beautifully.

Their music is confrontational and belligerent, but gloriously entertaining. Their pure, white-hot anger and existential frustration, combined with punchy, violent instrumentation allows them to ask the real questions. Questions like: “why don’t you like reggae? Even Tarquin likes reggae. Mary Berry loves reggae! So why don’t you like reggae?”. They also offer answers to other questions, questions like “what’s the best way to scare a Tory?”. Well, according to IDLES, its “to read and get rich”.

The band have zero qualms in “terrifying and entertaining in the same breath”. If that intrigues you, and it should, and you also fancy getting really sweaty, try and catch these guys at the Fleece on the 8th of March. It should be an experience and a half.
