Her soothing tones will be heard again! Subsequent to the exciting release of her new album Remember Us to Life at the end of this month, Regina Spektor, the Russian-American genius of a musician, will be performing at Colston Hall in Bristol on the 12th of November.

Having learnt how to the play the piano from the age of six, there is no doubt that Spektor has come a long way with her talent. She first released her debut album Begin to Hope back in 2006 where one of her best known singles, Fidelity, launched her career. Spektor has since gone on to release five other albums, with her seventh album to come out on the 30th of September - its first single being Bleeding Heart.

Not only limited to her own albums, Spektor’s beautiful voice has also made several appearances in films and television series. One of her most notable songs The Call was written for The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian in 2008 and more recently, she sang While My Guitar Gently Weeps as part of the soundtrack of the new animation Kubo and the Two Strings, released in mid-August.

If you’d like to listen to gentle yet powerful vocals that will melt away your university stresses and take you to your happy place, Regina Spektor is your girl. I guarantee she will not let you down.
