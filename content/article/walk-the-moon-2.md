American indie rock band Walk the Moon is set to play at the O2 Academy in Bristol on Monday, April 9th, 2018 at 7:00 p.m. The band is set to visit at least eight venues in the UK during the tour supporting their most recent album, What If Nothing.

Walk the Moon is based in Cincinnati, Ohio but was started when lead singer Nicholas Petricca was still in school at Kenyon College. The band is currently made up of members Nicholas Petricca, Kevin Ray, Sean Waugaman, and Eli Maiman, but the group has had several other members who have performed intermittent roles since the bands inception in 2008. The group released their debut album I want! I want! in November 2010 and received rave feedback for their single Anna Sun. They have since released three other studio albums; Walk the Moon (2012), Talking Is Hard (2014), and What If Nothing (2017). They have also released a live album of mixed work from throughout the years called You Are Not Alone (2016).

The band’s sound is a mixture of indie and rock, providing upbeat beats and lyrics interspersed with slower, more introspective songs throughout the albums. Their music has been characterized as indie rock, new wave, indie pop, and dance-rock. Talking Heads, David Bowie, The Killers, The Police, Tears for Fears, and Phil Collins are cited by Walk the Moon as main influences. The group’s live concerts are essentially large-scale dance parties, perhaps inspired by Walk the Moon’s message in their hit song Shut Up and Dance.
