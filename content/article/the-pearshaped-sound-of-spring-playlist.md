Spring Equinox marks the astronomical beginning of Spring and quite frankly I’m over the moon that we’re finally here. At last, days will get longer, temperatures will rise and the bleak drabness of winter will slowly start to fade away for another year. Although Spring signifies the start of revision and exams, it also provides a great excuse for heading outside for a drink in the afternoon and taking a well deserved break from an excessive amount of work (yeah, right) to bask in the glory of the Great British weather.

For some reason, Spring and Autumn often get ignored as seasons to celebrate musically, with summer and winter acquiring all of the attention. But here at PearShaped we have compiled a small seasonal soundtrack to get your Spring kick-started. From the aptly titled First Day of Spring by The Horrors to the delightfully warm and delicate riff of Bombay Bicycle Clubs’ Ivy and Gold, we’ve got your back.

_Listen to the PearShaped Sound of Spring Playlist below._
