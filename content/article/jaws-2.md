Not to be confused with the bond villain from ‘The Spy Who Loved Me’,  JAWS (the band) are an indie-pop three piece from Birmingham who have recently released their first full-length record: Simplicity. Frontman Connor Schofield describes the offering as [“the band’s most developed material to date"](https://bittersweetsymphonies.co.uk/2016/11/10/album-review-jaws-simplicity/), and I’m inclined to agree with him. Listening to Be Slowly, brought out back in 2014, their follow-up work boasts a sonic complexity and lyrical maturity which touches on a number of musical identities – from the romantic Cure-esque tone of opening number I’m Just A Boy to the more conventional alternative indie rock of Right In Front Of Me, loaded with guitar riffs and reverb; sounding like Birmingham’s response to the band DIIV.

Without any big surprises, simplicity is perhaps an apt name for the album. Every track feels well-polished and calculated, and it comes as no surprise that the work was recorded and produced by Oliver Horton, the man behind The Foal’s What Went Down – which felt similarly textbook. Although it may be the band’s most developed material to date, there is still room to grow. JAWS is still a relatively new group, showing signs of impressive progress, trying to find its place in the English indie-rock scene. Their gig at Exeter’s Phoenix promises an upcoming band going from strength to strength.

I would recommend JAWS to fans of The Foals, Temples or DIIV.
