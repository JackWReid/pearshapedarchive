Better Than Home is Beth Hart’s 12th album, one that deeply reflects the singers’ take on life. She looks back at her past whilst accepting her present, showing the audience that our lives aren’t perfect, but neither should they be. This “mature piece of work full of sincerity”, as The Blues Blast Magazine pointed out, will leave you with a feeling of deep satisfaction inside, because there is no doubt that Beth Hart is talented at finding ways to “feel and convert \[all the\] positive energy into music that moves people” (The Blues Blast Magazine).

The singers’ outstanding vocals could be partially compared to artists such as Sheryl Crow, Natalie Merchant and Tracy Chapman, but it is Harts’ individuality which makes her unique in the industry. Beth’s popularity is increasing by seconds as she has “hit after hit on chart after chart”, selling out venues all over the world including the US, Europe, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, and others. Better Than Home was nominated 4th in the Best Blues Album Of The Year chart by Mojo Magazine. In addition, her tracks have consistently made it into the Top 20 on the iTunes Blues Chart in Britain and USA.

It is, therefore, safe to say that Beth Harts’ compositions are the must-have for any pop, blues or rock fans out there, as the singer won’t let you down with the variety of styles she adopts in her albums. The singer has collaborated with the rock and blues legend, Joe Bonamassa, in their album Don’t Explain as well as performing together at multiple festivals in New York, Amsterdam and Switzerland.

If you have a passion for jazz and blues music, as well as spending time in a friendly atmosphere with people sharing similar tastes, then Colston Hall in Bristol is the place to be on the 17th November.
