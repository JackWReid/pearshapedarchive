Since their debut album four years ago, Keston Cobblers Club have very busy indeed; sharing their irresistibly charming folk sound with everyone that will listen. This five-piece consists of a group of old school friends, fronted by brother and sister duo Matthew and Julia, who bring a raw, contemporary folk sound.

They have taken their music around the world, performing at Glastonbury and The Great Escape to name but a few. Last year they released their second album entitled Wildfire. This unusual name for the album comes from their delightful four part harmonies and their folky percussion instrumental, which takes you on a musical journey, moving around a lot, spreading, and growing, the very characteristics of wildfire. This album pulled in new audiences and uncovered fans such as Dermot O'Leary who said, "Every song is an absolute killer, they're terrific".  If for some unbeknown reason you don't trust Dermot, you can go and check them out for yourselves at Colston Hall in Bristol, on the 23rd of October.

So, if you are interested in getting your sole healed (get it, because they are called Keston _Cobblers..._) then go and enjoy an evening of foot stomping music, based around old Folklore.
