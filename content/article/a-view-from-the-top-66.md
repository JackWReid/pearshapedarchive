According to the Billboard Hot 100, the number one across the pond is Black Beatles. In Japan, Koi by Gen Hoshino takes the top spot. The global number one, judged from downloads, streaming, and radio airplay, apparently, is 24K Magic. And yet, Rockabye is still at number one in the UK. And Germany, Australia, and New Zealand.

I’m happy to report, however, that the Canadian number one is The Weeknd’s Starboy, still, with most of his album making up the Hot 100.

It’s been a fairly stagnant few weeks on the charts, globally too, it seems. For us in the UK some songs - Neiked’s Sexual, James Arthur’s Say You Won’t Let Go, The Chainsmoker’s Closer, and a handful of other overplayed tracks - have spent the past month or so trading places in amongst themselves in the top 20 without much movement. This week in particular it’s been even worse, as the New Year has pushed a whole load of re-entries that should’ve been left in the dust where they belong. 7 Years? Stitches? Chandelier? I can’t think of any songs I’d want to listen to less.

There are some slow climbers in the middle right now, though, so all hope is not lost. A couple of weeks ago, I Don’t Wanna Live Forever by Zayn and Taylor Swift entered the charts, and now it’s made its way up from 36 to 23. Robbie William’s Love My Life sits just above it at 22, and Justin Timberlake’s Can’t Stop the Feeling is 21, all jumping up at least 10 places since last week. Right at the very top, Clean Bandit do still have their grubby little mitts on the number one, but Human by Rag’n’Bone Man is up again at two, and it’s popular. I’ve been hearing it everywhere, and now that we’re in the January hangover to December’s party season, something a bit more soulful with a lot less Sean Paul might be just what the doctor ordered.

Besides that, a few George Michael tracks have charted since his death on Christmas Day, but they will inevitably fall when the next legendary musician is iced. Shame. It was nice hearing Faith on the radio.

Over on the album charts, Little Mix’s seven week number one streak with Glory Days is being threatened by Pete Tong’s Classic House selection. It features a number of absolute belters, like Right Here, Right Now, Insomnia, and Pjanoo, all with the accompaniment of a 65 piece orchestra, so I would be pretty pleased if it managed to bag the top album for a few weeks. Why are people wasting time feeling nostalgic over the likes of Shawn Mendes and Sia when we have Eric Prydz to blast through our tinny headphones.
