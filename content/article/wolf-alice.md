‘Tis the season to be a Wolf Alice fan. This autumn sees the band release their new album, Visions Of A Life, and tour around the world to show off said album in a live setting.

The UK leg kicks off in Bristol - which is _already_ sold out – and will take the band to London’s Alexandra Palace for the first time. For someone who was at their first headline tour in a 300-capacity venue, to see them now playing the 2000-capacity O2 Academy does bring a proud tear to the eye.

Expect new singles Yuk Foo and Don’t Delete The Kisses to be brought out for a spin, as well as plenty more from the new album (which, I can confirm, is awesome). Wolf Alice live shows are always of excellent quality; they play off the crowd’s energy, and the crowd gives them their all. Expect shoes to be lost and drinks to be thrown.

Support comes from Sunflower Bean and long-time partners in crime Superfood.
