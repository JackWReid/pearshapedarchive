Sophie Ellis-Bextor isn’t having a comeback, because she hasn’t really gone anywhere. Say her name and the first thing that pops to mind is, of course, the iconic Murder On The Dancefloor, which was as close to vogueing as we were going to get in the year six school disco. She’s also married to that bloke from The Feeling, which is a pub quiz fact you can thank me for later. But she’s not just early 2000s Britpop trivia, she’s actually been chucking albums out at fairly regular intervals, the last being 2016’s Familia. All you need to know about the album how Ellis-Bextor herself described it in relation to her previous album Wanderlust, saying, “The Wanderlust girl moved away from Eastern Europe to the warmer, sunnier climate of South America where she's swapped vodka for tequila.” Honestly, that does it.

It’s from this platform that she jumps into her 2017 UK tour, heading down south at the end of February to cruise through Brighton’s Concorde and Portsmouth’s Wedgewood Rooms before coming west to Bristol’s Trinity Centre on February 28th. It’ll be a fun night of dancing to pop standards and swaying to the occasional ballad. She’ll almost certainly play Murder On The Dancefloor and Groovejet (If This Ain’t Love), which will most definitely be the best moments of the night, reliving your twelve year old glory days. Take a nostalgic trip to Claire’s Accessories and indulge in an orange and passionfruit J2O to set the mood. Your body will be in Trinity but your soul will be in a small town church hall, dancing with a boy in a black shirt with flames coming up from the hem.
