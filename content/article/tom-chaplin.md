Best known as the vocalist for the immensely popular pop-rock outfit Keane, Tom Chaplin may not himself be a household name, but his powerful yet vulnerable voice, as evident on such Keane classics as Somewhere Only We Know and Bend And Break, is as unmistakable as it is inimitable. After Keane went on hiatus in 2013 following the release of a Greatest Hits compilation, Chaplin decided to wander his own land and embark on a solo career. It is an endeavour that has culminated in a debut solo album, The Wave, set to be released on October 16th, as well as a tour spanning eight intimate locations across the UK. Chaplin will be touring alone for the first time since 2012.

Following a tour-opening set in Brighton, Chaplin stops off at Thekla in Bristol on October 23rd. Whilst Keane’s bombastic choruses and lush instrumentation were custom-built for stadiums, Chaplin’s softer, more melancholy solo material is a perfect fit for smaller venues such as Thekla, and as such you most likely won’t get to hear his music in a more appropriate context than this. Plus, there’s every chance he’ll unleash a few tunes from Keane’s back catalogue, which - take it from me, as someone who has lost his voice singing along to Everybody’s Changing in a live setting before- is something you won’t want to miss.
