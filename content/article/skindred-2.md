If there’s one definite thing you can say about Skindred it’s that you’ll never hear another band quite like them. On 9th November you'll be able to hear them drop their unique fusion of metal and reggae in Exeter’s very own Lemon Grove. With almost twenty years gigging experience to refine their destructive stage presence, the ferocity of Skindred is a force to be reckoned with. Not a single member of the band has taken his foot off the pedal at their recent shows, as any of the thousands who saw their chaotic performances on the main stages of Reading and Leeds this summer will tell you. The relentless energy the Newport six piece exert on stage fuels the raw power of songs such as Kill the Power perfectly_,_ with lead singer Benji Webbe spitting his way through angry verses to reach the defiant chorus, screaming with all he’s got: “No retreat and no surrender.”

After these formidable open-air performances in front of thousands the opportunity to see them tear it up in such an intimate venue is one not to be missed. A year after releasing his purely reggae solo album, Webbe is sure to hold nothing back when Skindred play The Lemon Grove on 9th November and, if previous shows are anything to go by, he won’t be letting his audience hold anything back either.
