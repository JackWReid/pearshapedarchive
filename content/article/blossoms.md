2016 was a whirlwind year for Blossoms. Formed in Manchester in 2013, the past couple of years have taken the indie pop/rock band from complete obscurity to the forefront of their genre. You only have to take a quick look at the figures to see how crazy things have been for them: the band played 41 festival dates over the summer of 2016, including appearances at Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds, and Boardmasters. Their eponymous debut EP hit number 1 in the UK Chart immediately, maintaining its position for two consecutive weeks and equalling records held by both Adele and Bowie in the process. Continuing on from the success of the album, the band sold out a UK Autumn/Winter tour, headlining and filling Shepherd’s Bush Empire. To top it all off, Blossoms then went on to successfully release an extended edition of their debut EP, packaging together 10 new tracks. All of this in the space of a year and a bit – but it doesn’t stop there.

This year the band are hoping to keep the ball rolling, embarking on yet another tour. Blossoms are bringing their 80’s pop/rock sound to Exeter’s very own Lemon Grove, a treat you’ll really regret missing out on. If you need more than impressive figures and stats to feel enticed, just take a listen to any one of their tracks. You’ll understand the hype in no time.
