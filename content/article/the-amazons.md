Over the past few years, predominantly underground genres have amassed increasingly commercial followings. Skepta and Stormzy, for instance, are but two artists who have spearheaded the mainstream consumption of the grime genre. Of course, the commercialisation – and, quite frankly, the legitimisation – of previously obscure genres is a fantastic prospect. For one, an innovative sound is recognised and brought to the forefront. Secondly, underground movements and their pioneers tend to hail from diverse backgrounds and demographics which had often been left underrepresented. Where, then, does the traditional guitar band sit?

Liam Gallagher recently bemoaned that modern rock bands 'only wear guitars because they go with their shoes', whilst Paul Weller launched a scathing attack on the 'insipid' state of modern guitar music. Naysaying icons aside, guitar bands are as relevant as ever before. They are, however, in dialogue with an incredibly expansive and competitive collection of alternate mainstream genres. To prove it, The Amazons have earned themselves inclusion in the BBC Sound of 2017 list, a place on NME’s Bands to Listen to in 2017 list, and a slot at BBC Radio 1’s Future Festival.

Needless the say, the quartet – who released their eponymous debut album in May – authenticate the notion that guitar bands still have their place amidst a music scene that is in perpetual motion. Their sound serves as an eclectic fusion between grunge and old-fashioned hard rock, and is sure to invigorate any location in which they perform. Currently, the group are scheduled to circuit around Britain, performing at an array of destinations from Edinburgh to Portsmouth. Exeter’s Phoenix is the most southerly point on the band’s itinerary, and though their stay shall be a fleeting one – they are playing in London’s Kentish Town the following evening – The Amazons are undoubtedly a hot prospect, and certainly one that is not to be avoided.
