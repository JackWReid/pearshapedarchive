Glass Caves released their debut, and so far only album in 2014, filled with songs not unlike those you would find on a Catfish and the Bottlemen record. The four-piece from Yorkshire are now touring to promote their new EP – I Do, featuring the songs Swim and Do You Have A Name. These anthemic indie-pop tunes are filled with atmosphere that is sure to fill the Exchange.

The band grew from busking on streets to spread their music and build a closer relationship with their fans to playing a live session for BBC Radio 2 this year, and are playing bigger venues such as the O2 Academy Sheffield for this tour. Seeing Glass Caves in a smaller venue such as the Exchange could be one of the last opportunities to see this band in a more intimate location, when they play on the 17th October. Glass Caves will be supported by local bands Razz, The Hideaways and Bordello, which makes this an excellent opportunity to see some up-and-coming bands.

With only one album out and a bunch of catchy songs, both fans of the band and people looking to have an enjoyable time should check this gig out, as it promises to be lively, energetic and memorable.
