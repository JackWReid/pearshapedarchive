The Liverpudlian indie rockers return the music scene with a highly anticipated second album and tour. Having captured the attention and feel-good vibes of fans and critics alike with their first album, Young Chasers, the big questions is whether Circa Waves can take their sound and performance to the next level. If radio networks are anything to go by, the answer is yes. The first two singles to be released from the album, Wake Up and Fire That Burns have been played extensively across music platforms over the last month. With a heavier sound, Circa Waves seem to have added more depth and atmospheric rock to this record. Note that they still maintain the killer chorus that gets people on their feet. It will thus be interesting to see how the second album, Different Creatures, appears as a whole when released on 10th March.

Circa Waves produce an energetic, head-bopping and heart-racing live performance. They will look to have built upon their sets in their time away from the circuit. Playing at the O2 Academy in Bristol on March 27th, much will be expected of the band to provide further sing-along-indie-disco vibes. Whether the second album goes down with the crowd well or not, only time will tell. Regardless, expect the scintillating favourites such as T-Shirt Weather, Fossils and Stuck In My Teeth to transport you back to the sun shining summer of 2015.
