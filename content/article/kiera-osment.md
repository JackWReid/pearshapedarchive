Local to Devon, Kiera Osment is a 14-year old singer-songwriter with more talent than you can shake a drumstick at. Long-listed in 2013 for Glastonbury’s Emerging Talent competition and winning best vocalist at a London Song Academy competition are just a couple of Kiera’s achievements. Rest assured, we can expect plenty more from this piano-playing, guitar-plucking, pen-wielding artist.

_**As it says on your **[website](http://kieraosmentmusic.com/)**, you learnt to play the piano at age 6, and then learnt classical piano at age 9. Did you know from a young age that you wanted to be a performing musician?**_ No, at age 9, I had no thought about performing - it was only when I got bored of singing my newly-written songs to my parents at 11 that I wanted to go out and play to an audience. So I went to my local open mic at The Reform in Barnstaple and from that moment, I got the bug for it.

_**Can you recall some of the first songs you ever wrote, and what they were about?**_ Yes, I can - the first is one called Sunshine (there were a lot of songs about the weather in the early days!), then Hiking Up, written on a rainy when I was bouncing and dancing along in puddles. Next was Fade Away, which probably started the miserable trend in my songs. After that it was Lost Love; this song means a lot to the family, as it was written for my great-Grandma after she died. I wrote these when I was around 7 or 8, but they're on my Soundcloud somewhere!

_**You play the piano, the guitar, and also the cello – have you got a favourite?**_ My favourite is the piano - this is what has been by my side the longest. I did play the violin, flute, and clarinet once, but these instruments didn’t inspire me like the piano, guitar, and cello, although I still play them from time to time. I would love to play the harp and bass guitar, one day… I dream of having a big room full of different instruments.

_**What’s the creation process like for you? Are a lot of your songs very personal to your own life?**_ All my songs are personal to some degree - a lot of them are inspired by other people’s experiences, but I try to connect myself to them as much as I can. The writing process seems to be a game of chance; most of the time, it seems the lyrics come first, but sometimes I sit at the piano and it all comes together, melody and lyrics at the same time. I never sit down and write a song for the sake of it; I have to get that moment of inspiration - in what I call my song-writing mode - and when I get that moment, everything else is dropped for it. The song-writing process is never the same each time.

_**Your song, Titanic, is beautiful. Where did the inspiration for this song come from?**_ Actually, this song was based upon three individuals' points of view - the first is a mother's who lost her child. The second is the Titanic’s point of view, personified. The third is the lost child's from the first verse, thinking about being rescued. I got inspiration for the song after reading a book about a mother who adopted the ‘Titanic child’ as her own, so it’s sort of based on a real life passenger. I'm currently writing a sequel to the song as there’s so much to say about the subject, and my sequel follows seven peoples lives, based on true events.

_**Your other song, Become A Little Wiser, is filled with positivity and inspiration. What’s the story behind this song?**_ Some weeks before I wrote this, I had jotted down some lyrics about how I felt about home education, and then forgot about them. Then on Christmas Eve 2012, I woke up feeling excited about Christmas and the thought of the new year ahead, and wanted to write something uplifting. I remembered my old notes and added to them. I think the lyrics sum up my life really well - I am wandering along and hopefully becoming a little wiser, learning from people and my life around me. It’s about trying things and seeing where they go.

_**Do you feel that being home-schooled has effected you creatively?**_ It definitely effects me creatively, as I never know what I’ll do from one day to the next - although I am doing some of the main subjects, and I even sat a GCSE recently. I can study how and when I want; if I want to have a mad afternoon studying Italy or something as random as finding out about law, I can. It never fails to excite me, all the things that I can do because of this. I’m living life now, instead of waiting until I’ve left school, and that has a huge impact on my creativity and writing.

_**Do you feel that your age has an effect on your musical career, or does it not make a difference?**_ I do feel my age has an effect on my career, which can be frustrating, as a lot of people and venues automatically assume a younger person isn’t able to cope with live sets and a career. I believe people should book me on whether they like what they hear and my past experience - not on my age. Although I’m pretty shy off-stage, performing my songs is something I feel very comfortable with, and I’m very lucky to have my two minders by my side (a.k.a. my Mum and Dad).

_**If you had to pick three artists that have influenced your sound, who would you pick?**_ I always struggle to answer this question, as I am the kind of person who flits from one genre to another! I’d have to say Ludivico Einaudi - an Italian contemporary classical pianist. My parents listened to a lot of Coldplay when I was younger, and I still do now, so I am probably influenced by them as well. Lastly, maybe Sarah McLachlan.

_**What are your top three favourite books?**_ Number one would have to be Divergent by Veronica Roth, which I thought I’d hate as it strays from my usual genre of reading (which is probably historical romance \[cringes\]). Second is The Captain’s Daughter by Leah Flemming. I’m embarrassed as I can’t remember the name of the last book, or the author - but it was a wonderful book series about early settlers in Australia, following the lives of three families trying to survive in a harsh environment… despite my lack of memory about the names, the stories have really stuck with me.

_**You’ve played a live session on BBC Introducing Devon. How did you pick which songs to play, and how did it feel not being able to see your listening audience?**_ I chose my three favourites at the time: Titanic, Become A Little Wiser, and Communication. It didn’t bother me too much that I couldn’t see the audience - it added some mystery to it that faceless people were listening. However, it was really weird for my parents who were listening in the same room.

_**You have played at many festivals, such as the Cornwall Folk Festival and Brisfest. What is it like playing on these larger stages?**_ I think it’s easier to perform on a bigger stage - when it’s a very small venue and people are looking you in the eye it feels much more intimidating. Although some of my favourite gigs have been in a small, intimate atmosphere, it does unnerve me a little more.

_**What are some of your favourite on-stage moments?**_ Supporting Roseanna Ball at the Queen’s Theatre in Barnstaple this September was very memorable; I was in one of those bubbles where you feel like you’re waking up from a coma when the set is finished. That incredible outer-body feeling doesn’t happen at every gig, so it’s amazing when it does. Supporting Edwina Hayes was also really memorable – she’s a very talented singer-songwriter and lovely, although I was more nervous at this gig because I was a human disaster during soundcheck, but the nerves went once I started and I loved the whole set.

_**Do you have any favourite songs to perform?**_ My songs Possessed and Twisted have been fun to play lately - I can go a little mad in places and people don’t expect it. A few high powerful parts, and in some places you can really whack the piano.

_**What advice do you have for anyone who’s just starting out on their creative path?**_ Be yourself, take advice sometimes, don’t take everything to heart, don’t change to fit other people’s ideas about who you should be. Someone online once said to me, “Never let a seed of doubt take over”. I think all us musicians are a sensitive species, so it would be easy to be full of doubt.

_**If you could have any rider request in the world, what would you ask for?**_ A huge bowl of my Grandma’s apple crumble, made from our allotment apples. It’s the nicest crumble ever.

_Kiera is currently recording her first EP, due for release in 2015._
