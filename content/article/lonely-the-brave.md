Cambridge alt-rock five piece Lonely The Brave will take to the stage at Motion & The Marble Factory in Bristol on October 7th, as part of a tour following their second album Things Will Matter. The band’s first album The Day’s War went double platinum in the UK and the follow up record does not disappoint. The sound alone of front man David Jakes’ tortured singing carries the raw emotion the band are trying to convey. When this is combined with powerful lyrics such as “Here truth is found down on its knees” or “We’re screaming out from the jaws of hell” the result is haunting, hence the description by Rock Sound suggesting they are one of the few bands who are still “really bleeding on record”.

The band has had a busy 2016, releasing not only their new album but also an EP back in August. They have achieved a lot in their relatively short career, only releasing their first album in 2015, with the anthemic choruses on songs like Dust and Bones suggesting they could soon be tackling arenas as well as the more intimate venues they currently play. They are definitely one to watch, so don’t miss out.
