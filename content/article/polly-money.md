_**C: Hi Polly, have you enjoyed playing in Exeter tonight in front of such a big crowd?**_ I had an awesome time! It was such a friendly crowd. I’ve been to Exeter a few times because I don’t live that far from here, but yeah it was awesome.

_**J: In your set you were talking about how you supported Muse. Matt Bellamy saw you busking I believe. It’s an amazing story!**_ Matt Bellamy just walked past the stage I was playing at, at a place called Marylebone Summer Fair. A couple of days later he invited me out to support him - Dizzee Rascal and Biffy Clyro were there as well so it was pretty insane!

_**J: Have you got any upcoming shows you would like to let people know about?**_ If anyone is in Shrewsbury I’m supporting this wicked blues artist \[Blues Boy Dan Owen\] from the 1st-5th December at the Henry Tudor House. Apart from that I’m just organising stuff for next year - tours and festivals and all that fun stuff.

_**C: Are you doing any recordings at the moment?**_ _\[laughs\]_ It’s all under wraps at the moment! We plan to go back into the studio; I’ve got a few new songs that I want to get down. So we’ll see what happens - you’ll have to keep updated!

_**J: How can the PearShaped following keep updated with you?**_ My website is **[pollymoney.com](http://www.pollymoney.com)**. It’s got my Facebook and Twitter on it so just Like that and keep up to date with my stuff.
