Finally, they are back! It has been a two and a half year long wait since Two Door Cinema Club have performed their own headline show in the UK, but for a limited time, the synth-rock trio will return. Since their third album release, Gameshow, the band have significantly re-invented their sound, opting for an 80s inspired disco-funk record that has shaken the fan base to the core. This rebranding, though potentially straying away their indie-rock moshable roots, now adds a more danceable groove to group’s discography. The compulsion to sway promises to be irresistible!

In case you haven’t realized, the 80s are “in” at the moment. Between Netflix’s Stranger Things, or the rise of 80s inspired bands like The 1975 and Chvrches, Two Door Cinema Club are yet another property championing this trend. At the same time, their traditional guitar riffs, creative lyricism and Trimble’s soaring falsettos have not gone amiss. Be prepared to be hit with a wave of sound with the likes of Are We Ready? (Wreck) and Gameshow, as well as to be gently caressed by the smooth ballad of Invincible or the sexy sax of Ordinary. Additionally, the fanfare of classics like Something Good Can Work and Sleeps Alone will provide an unrivalled hysteria and an atmosphere three years in the making for the Bristolian venue.

Whether you want to relive some of the best guitar work modern music has to offer, or you want to get down and groove on to Two Door’s new style, the O2 Academy Bristol gifts a prime opportunity to get all nostalgic. Though the band are likely to return to our shores for the summer festival season, for the full uncut experience, attending this event is highly advised.
