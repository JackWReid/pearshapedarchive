If you think that the West Country goes with Americana about as well as pineapple on pizza (seriously, _why_), then you clearly don’t know about Owl in the Sun. The Bath-based blues band released their debut album, Outside the City Way of Things, in 2011 to critical acclaim from everyone from Greg James, who has played them on his Radio 1 show, to Mark Kermode. The same year, the band played on the Introducing Stage at Glastonbury, and have since gone on to support acts like Adrian Edmonson on tour and also released their sophomore album, entitled Black House_._

Owl in the Sun’s “gypsy jazz” style of music is folky and timeless, with upbeat, narrative songs like Hay Bluff Revelations contrasting with more soulful ones such as Flags, all of them having the same tone and style that leads to them having an excellent presence live. Their one-off, upcoming gig will be on Saturday the 12th of November in Stoke St. Mary Village Hall, which will no doubt be an intimate venue well-suited to their personal style.
