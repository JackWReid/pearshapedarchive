Country artists are few and far between in the UK, and aside from the yearly C2C: Country to Country weekender at The O2 Arena in London, Stateside big names making a trip across the pond is a bit of a rarity. After playing C2C earlier this year, Dan + Shay are returning to the UK for a 6-date tour, including one night at the Trinity Centre in Bristol.

Dan + Shay made names for themselves as performers supporting Hunter Hayes and Blake Shelton, before embarking on their debut headline tour in 2014. They have since toured all over the States, played at the iconic country venue The Grand Ole Opry and been nominated multiple times for Vocal Duo of the Year, at both the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Country Music Association Awards.

Dan Smyers and Shay Mooney have been a songwriting duo since meeting in Nashville in 2012. Within two months they had received multiple publishing offers and signed a record deal with Warner/Chappell Music. Their debut album, ‘Where It All Began’ featured the number 1 single “Nothin’ Like You’, and made them the first duo to debut at number 1 on Billboard’s Country Albums Chart. Their second album ‘Obsessed’ was released in summer of 2016, reaching number 1 in the UK Country Music Chart.

Dan + Shay know where their strengths lie and what their sound is. The set for this tour is likely to be largely songs from newer release ‘Obsessed’, but older hits are guaranteed to make an appearance. The old and new will blend almost as seamlessly as the duo’s harmonies. If you’re a fan of country, or if you’re willing to give (in my humble opinion) the UK’s most underrated and underexposed genre a chance, you do not want to miss this.
