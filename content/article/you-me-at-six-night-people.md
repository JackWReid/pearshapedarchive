If you’re reading this review you’re probably already a You Me At Six fan hoping that I agree with you on your deep love for the new album Night People. That, or you used to be a fan and you’re wondering what the band are up to now. Should you give them another listen? Well, if you’re going to take my advice then I say go grab Night People and come back to listen along with my review.

While the album’s eponymous lead single starts with a bizarre buzzing sound, I can assure you that it fails to represent the album. It’s got a slow but strong beat and you can skip right past it to delve into the good stuff. I worried it might deter some listeners from continuing so let’s move swiftly on…

My first listen of Plus One didn’t blow me away but the unique instrumentation and changing tempos has really dug a special place in my heart. I recommend multiple listens for full appreciation. You’ll be happy to hear it’s the worst of an incredible bunch of songs. Seems wrong labelling it “worst” but in this context I promise that’s a good thing. If you’re a fan of Josh Franceschi’s mumbling, charismatic vocals then Heavy Soul will bring you endless joy. Quirky riffs and some belting is a winning combination for You Me At Six. It’s great to see them balance this kind of song with the follow up track Take On The World.

For those that stood by You Me At Six when they released power ballad Fireworks back in 2010, Take On The World will show you just how far the band have come and confirm that _they really were meant to make these kinds of songs too._ Take On The World might have simple instrumentation, but this only provides the vocals with full focus.

> “Nobody knows you the way that I know you / Look in my eyes I will never desert you.”

Previously You Me At Six have found their strengths in their raging rock tunes but with this record they’ve proven that they can take on any mood, any pace, any style, and make it their own. Give, Take On The World and Spell It Out For You are arguably their best songs. Give in particular is dripping with meaning and emotion as Josh sings, “I’ve been wasting all this time, trying to keep you off my mind / But no more.”

From slower, sentimental tracks to the band’s traditional rock tunes (plus some extra groove), Night People transitions into Swear beautifully, using the song Brand New to build a tension in the album. There’s a place for everything on this record and I can see live audiences going mental for Swear on You Me At Six’s upcoming tour, I mean _those drums._

Can’t Hold Back, Make Your Move and every other song are memorable and distinct with great hooks and range. I’m glad they cut the album back to just 10 songs as it gives each one the attention it deserves. It’s definitely in line with the sound You Me At Six established in their last album Cavalier Youth but combines a lot more experimentation from some diverse musical influences.

For me, Night People captures their youthful sound with a natural maturity. They aren’t the same guys that released Take Off Your Colours, but that’s okay. They’re older, wiser, and producing better music than ever.
