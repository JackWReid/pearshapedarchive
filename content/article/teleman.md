“I don’t know if other bands do this,” [muses](http://birminghampromoters.com/Events/teleman-feb-2017/) Tommy Sanders, frontman of London three-piece band Teleman, “but in our rehearsal room we had a white board, and for each song we’d write the chords up on the white board … we’ve got different colour pens and stuff.”

Although this may invoke the image of a Geography student revising for their January exams, it perfectly epitomises the unique quirkiness behind the band’s two excellent records; Breakfast and Brilliant Sanity. The latest release, Brilliant Sanity, is an art-pop masterpiece, combining inspired song writing, catchy basslines and crafty lyrics to create a truly memorable album.

The band have come a long way since its previous incarnation, Pete and the Pirates, honing their dreamy indie sonic through years of experience on the road and in the studio. The three of them even organise all aspects of their touring themselves, and enjoy meeting fans after the show (often selling their own merchandise like a true indie band).

If you enjoy the likes of Django Django, Yeasayer or Alt-J, it’s worth catching Teleman at Exeter’s Phoenix in February.
