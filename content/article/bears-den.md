The London-based alternative rock duo Bear’s Den are no strangers to touring. In 2012 their cross-country trip across America with Nathaniel Rateliff, The Staves and Ben Howard was chronicled in Austin to Boston, a documentary by James Marcus Haney that premiered at the 58th BFI London Film Festival. Since then the band have traversed several countries, touring Europe and Australia. They’ve played sold-out US tours, both in support of Mumford & Sons and as headliners in their own right.

Their second studio album, Red Earth & Pouring Rain, released in July 2016, riffs on tropes of American road music. In their sophomore album, Bear’s Den keep to their folk rock roots but showcase a new depth to their sound. The duo use vivid lyrical imagery to explore themes of love and anguish, with vocalist Andrew Davie’s attention to detail rendering each song poignant and relatable for the listener.

Bear’s Den have a strong track record of sell-out tours and performances at a slew of international festivals, including Glastonbury, Reading, BBK and Dockville, to name just a few. Now the duo are set to take the stage at the O2 Academy Bristol on 9th November. The new album is stunning, but to hear these songs at their best, you’ll need to take the train north-bound to watch the band play live.
