The world seems to have developed a serious plight of magical realism; the instance when a realistic narrative is invaded by something so strange it seems beyond reality or fantasy. Take, for instance, Donald Trump’s ENTIRE election campaign, Boris Johnson is Foreign Secretary after campaigning for Brexit, Jamie Vardy is still not officially endorsed by Monster Energy drinks. It seems the world is out of tilt, and is becoming an increasingly scarier place. Luckily, I am here, a person who always meets expectation because they are initially low. So, without further, ado welcome back to another week of ramblings from a consistently penniless columnist; who needs good when you have consistent?

Last week we took a sneaky peak at the work of Charlie Kim, future blues artist from L.A., which you can check out [here](http://pearshapedexeter.com/freebie-friday-7/). This week, our gaze will be cast upon the works of Gramatik, originally from Slovenia, currently residing in New York City, who has had the grace to release his whole works for free. Ever there was someone who could be the patron saint of this column, it would be Gramatik; believing that it is "morally right for music to be primarily free." Moreover, he’s even put out #digitalfreedom, an album opposing the internet censorship bills like SOPA, ACTA and PIPA. This gentleman’s core belief is free and freedom is more air tight then the trousers Olly Murs performs in.

Gramatik started his career at young age of 13 when he listened to jazz, funk and blues. Later on, he became interested in the hip hop works of Dr. Dre and RZA to name a few. This lead to his production of hip hop beats with a truly chilled out quality. A lot of his stuff is mainly instrumental meaning it works great for background or revision music, although the tracks with features are also must listens; it’s refreshing hearing alternative beats that aren’t just a wild bassline and condoning of codeine habits.

Normally, my decision is made simple; the work that is free is the one I review. Selfishly, Gramatik hasn’t given me this luxury. Similar to a diabetic in a sweet shop, my choice is a dangerous one. Wary of leaving out an important piece, I’m going to keep it simple and showcase Native Son ft. Raekwon , Leo Napier which comes from his most recent release Epigram, whilst heavily suggesting that anyone who likes it go check out the rest of his material.

So, if your bank is as desperate as this writers ability to think of an adequate pun for a conclusion (insufficient funds), have a look at Gramatik’s stuff to pick you up, no credit score required.

Until next week, Viva la revolución!
