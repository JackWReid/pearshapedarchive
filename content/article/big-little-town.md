This Tuesday at 7 p.m., American country group Little Big Town are to cross the pond and appear at Colston Hall in Bristol. Comprised of Karen Fairchild, Kimberly Schlapman, Jimi Westbrook, and Phillip Sweet, this group has been jamming together since 1998. They are predominantly known for their impressive four-part harmonies, which add to their unique sound because they do not have a distinctive frontman. Little Big Town is one of the most prominent names in current country music, having achieved stardom in both America and the United Kingdom. The quartet has won multiple awards, including two Grammys for their songs Pontoon and Girl Crush. Their most recent single, Better Man, was written by Taylor Swift and holds the Number One slot on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs Chart. Little Big Town has appeared in concert with other big country names as Keith Urban, Rascal Flatts, and Dustin Lynch. This is their fourth headlining tour.

With their unique harmonization and critically acclaimed tracks, Little Big Town’s shows have been described as homey and comfortable. Rolling Stone [calls](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/little-big-town-team-with-pharrell-williams-on-new-album-wanderlust-20160524) them “irresistibly upbeat”, while fans compare them to Lady Antebellum and The Band Perry. Their rich sound, soulful lyrics, and on-stage chemistry make for an intimate mood, regardless of the size of the venue. Little Big Town will be supported by Seth Ennis, a rising country star from America. Ennis is a singer/songwriter and plays a variety of instruments and is best known for his self-penned single Woke Up In Nashville. He is also signed under Arista Nashville, the same record label with which Little Big Town has a contract.

This show is a must for all country fans, but all who appreciate a good harmony should come along on Tuesday night - you won’t want to miss out on seeing these Grammy winners in person!
