**_Congratulations on the success of your second album, Work It Out. How has the response been different to Like I Used To?_** I’m sure some people will prefer my first album and some people will prefer my second, that’s just how it is. I feel like Work It Out better represents me as I’ve really been making the music that I want to.

**_Where has been your favourite place to tour?_** There are so many places yet to tour and I’m sure Iceland will be my favourite. I’ve never been there before but I’m really excited because it’s a really beautiful place. I’ve also been to some lovely places in Europe, especially in Germany.

**_On your dream tour, who would you take with you?_** Honestly, the support acts I’ve had on this tour. It would be an insult to them to say otherwise – they are all so talented. There’s Flyte, Billie Marten, Jake Isaac and Mercury-nominated C Duncan.

**_How do you choose what songs will become singles and receive music videos?_** I take a lot of advice from other people choosing singles these days. I hate it when people listen to just one of my singles and judge my whole album by that song because it doesn’t truly represent all that I want it to. So generally I just go with what I am told will get the most radio-play because that’s an important way to reach more listeners. When it comes to music videos, I used to make a lot of similar videos and although now I have less say over my videos they are generally a lot better as they represent the songs well.

**_Is there a specific song from Work It Out that you particularly love?_** I love them all. I feel like they are all combined in the album to represent the music I really enjoy creating.

**_Which is your favourite to perform live?_** The fun songs are always great to play live as you can just rock out to them. But that doesn’t mean that performing Shiver from Like I Used To is bad because I think that’s a song I can use to really connect with the audience.

**_If you had to cover a song right now what would it be and why?_** Whatever I could learn quickest! No, I love this Shirley Bassey version of a song but I don’t know who sang it is originally…

**_What’s been the best opportunity you’ve had in your music career?_** I’ve done a lot of work with Bombay Bicycle Club which has all been great experience. I performed on the Jools Holland Show with Manic Street Preachers which was incredible! Glastonbury 2014 was also a lot of fun.

**_Have you met any people through your music career you are particularly happy to know?_** Yes definitely, most of the time the people you work with become your closest friends and I’m lucky enough for that to happen to me.

**_What do you want to achieve in the next year or so?_** I might go on tour with a band but I haven’t got the money to do that at the moment. I really want to create a video for my song Nebraska. I’d also love to create an acoustic EP of me playing really raw piano versions of a few songs from Work It Out – that’ll probably never happen though.
