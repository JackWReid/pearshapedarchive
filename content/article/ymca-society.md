The YMCA Society works with the charity of the same name to mobilise students to get involved in helping the homeless youth in Exeter. The society works to help vulnerable teens through various volunteering efforts and through fundraising events, such as the annual sleepeasy, abseiling down the Princesshay shopping centre, or an acoustic night – the reason for this article.

\*Disclaimer: I am part of the society but I’m sure you can forgive the plug, it’s for a great cause, it’s good fun and I’d urge you to get involved if you’re interested in helping young people who have experienced homelessness.

Anyone looking for a chill Monday night should come down to John Gandy’s for some drinks and a chance to hear talented students. Andy Kitcatt, Bryony Loveless, and others will be performing covers of much loved classics. Jo Summers will even be playing some of her own music, so if you’re interested in what student musicians have to offer, come on down. Exeter’s favourite sassy all-female jazz group the Bluebelles are on the bill. They’ll likely bring their a cappella bubbly energy – that took them to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival – with them, which should make for some great sing-alongs. The YMCA singing group, composed of workers and residents at the shelter, will also be performing. Overall, it’s a good opportunity to support some disadvantaged youth in their artistic endeavours.

There’s nothing like an acoustic guitar to get you in a Summer mood, so bring some friends and imagine you’re in a field drinking cider with no deadlines, no exams pressing in from all sides… threatening to eclipse everything that you enjoy about life. If you’re interested in finding out a bit more about the society, we’d love to see you there.
