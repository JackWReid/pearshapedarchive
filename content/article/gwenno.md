This month, veteran Welsh electro-pop artist Gwenno will be taking the stage at Exeter’s very own Lemon Grove. This will be the final stop on a successful tour of the UK that has included gigs in London and Bristol as well as her hometown of Cardiff.

No stranger to the music industry, Gwenno Saunders, a former member of the girl group The Pipettes, made waves with her 2015 debut solo album delivered in her native Welsh. Whilst the majority of her listeners will not be Welsh speakers, her melodic vocals and intricate soundscapes allow Gwenno to transcend the language barrier. Having already established herself as an artistic force, Gwenno received further acclaim for her 2018 album, Le Kov and made her TV debut on Later… with Jools Holland with the standout track Tir Ha Mor. This distinctive concept album about Cornwall is sung entirely in the almost extinct Cornish language, of which Gwenno is among the last remaining native speakers. The album’s fusion of layered psychedelia and tranquil pop beats perfectly complements the mysterious ancient language in which the lyrics are delivered.

With a full band to support her, Gwenno certainly has a lot to offer in a live setting. This gig promises to be an exciting and unique night at the Lemmy!
