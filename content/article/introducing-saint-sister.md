Having previously been solo musicians, Gemma Doherty and Morgan MacIntyre came together, becoming fast friends and loyal bandmates. As a listener of Morgan’s previous solo work, I was always impressed with the story-telling lyrics she could conjure and I’m excited to say that Gemma has brought a whole new load of talent to the table with her traditional Irish harp that allows the pair to create dreamy pop music.

Morgan’s soulful voice is her most valuable asset and her recent addition of keyboard to live performances will be interesting if included in their debut EP. Meanwhile, Gemma’s harp gives them a unique Irish twist and classic edge that fills a gap in the music industry that would otherwise go unnoticed. I can’t say, they’re like \[insert band name here\]; I can’t even tell you that they’re a mash up of several bands or musicians as they truly are one-of-a-kind.

Placing their sound to one side, Saint Sister recently toured across Ireland supporting SPIES and made a TV appearance on TG4. Hoping to bring their music to the attention of the rest of the UK, they have finished recording their debut EP, set for imminent release.

Maybe I’m biased, or maybe they are really as good as I’m saying. Either way, you’ll never unless you give them a listen.
