In 2002, actor Craig Charles started his own radio show on BBC Radio 2. 15 Years later, the show, now on Radio 6 Music, is the stations longest-running programme, and Charles is arguably one of the biggest tastemakers in the soul music scene. His deep knowledge of music across decades is apparent simply from his track selections. Very few could boast a resume as deep as Charles: a successful compilation series; being responsible for the funk supergroup The Fantasy Funk Band; and, of course, his club night, Craig Charles's Funk and Soul Club.

On Friday 6th October, he brings his show to Phoenix with support from Grammy Award winning director turned reggae/punk crossover DJ, Don Letts. Letts recently released a compilation album: Culture Clash Radio, based on his Radio 6 Music show of the same name. The sold out night will follow a performance at Manchesterís iconic Band on the Wall venue.

The show marks the beginning of Lost Weekend, a three day festival featuring live music, technology and art throughout the city. The idea for the mixture of media was inspired in part by Austinís SXSW. The festival will be headlined by London-based art rockers Public Service Broadcasting, who are set to play in Exeter Cathedral. This is a must attend event for classic Motown and Atlantic fans as well as modern funk and soul lovers, and it is a perfect way to open what is set to be a fantastic weekend.
