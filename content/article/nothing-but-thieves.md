Nothing But Thieves exploded onto the British rock scene in 2015 with their self- titled album, which led to their first sell out tour. Since then, they’ve ended up briefly postponing song writing, music production and performance in order to support MUSE on their Drones tour, toped the UK vinyl charts and in addition released a highly acclaimed second album.

Band frontman Conor Mason’s brave and public revelations of his personal battle with mental health during the band’s first tour, have provided insight and drawn attention to the necessity to change the way in which we view mental health and challenge the everyday conversation that surrounds the subject. Nothing But Thieves have become massive advocates for the IAMWHOLE mental health campaign, which lead to them playing London’s BT Tower in October. Broken Machine is permeated with personal experience and epitomises Mason’s belief that stigma surrounding mental health issues should be confronted, particularly echoed in songs such as Get Better and Sorry.

With their alternative sound and politically charged content that explores the unsettling human insecurity of man as the machine, Nothing But Thieves as a five piece are set to heavily mark the British rock scene, but beyond that, they are talented, seriously talented. Powerful lyrics and experimental rhythms are balanced by Mason’s insane raw falsetto, which is pushed to breaking point in songs such as Amsterdam and Broken Machine, and honestly its stunning.

For fans of MUSE and Radiohead, this is certainly a band to watch, and in November they’ll be embarking on their pretty much sold out tour. They’ve successfully filled out London’s Roundhouse for two nights in a row in late November, and for those who have tickets to Bristol next week, damn you’re lucky.
