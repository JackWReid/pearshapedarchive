Emerging British Pop and RnB artist Mahalia is performing at University of Exeter’s most happening venue – The Lemon Grove! This extremely young and talented artist has her own style, and her music is mellow and groovy and sticks with you as soon as you listen to it. She has worked with iconic artists like Ed Sheeran who also tweeted about her, has collaborated with Rudimental and has been working with the producer of Drake’s Hotline Bling. There is nothing that can stop her from doing what she’s best at – making some really great music! She has been playing guitar and writing music as a child and was signed to a major record label when she was only 13 years old! She has already toured the UK thrice and has an above average experience in the music industry so far at just the age of 19. With acoustic and soul pumping through her veins, Mahalia has a lot to offer as a musician, emotionally and musically. A plus to listening to her live is that she always tells her listeners the story behind every song she performs.

An absolute fan of her smashing hit “Sober”? Well, you have the perfect opportunity of listening to Mahalia herself sing it live!
