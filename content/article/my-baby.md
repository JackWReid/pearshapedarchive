With their swampish sound and video visuals reminiscent of an American Horror Story opening credits sequence, a live performance from the Amsterdam-based trio My Baby is sure to be one to remember. The band combines a heavy blues style with riffing funk beats, creating a psychedelic accompaniment to vocalist Cato van Dijck's ethereal voice. The result is unique and soul-shaking, and it comes as no surprise to hear that they were discovered by Larry Graham - Prince's guitarist. Since then My Baby have supported Seasick Steve on tour, had multiple sets at Glastonbury and toured everywhere from the Netherlands to New Zealand. Their latest run of shows comes as an accompaniment to the release of their third album, Prehistoric Rhythm, and one of their first stops is Exeter Phoenix. If you want to escape the early September club nights for a different kind of madness, My Baby's gig should be at the top of your list.
