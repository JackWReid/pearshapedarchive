Neo Jessica Joshua, who you might as NAO, has landed firmly on two feet in 2016 with the release of her debut album For All We Know. It’s full of big songs, full of life and emotion, that get lodged in the back of your brain for hours at a time. After working with other artists (she was featured on Disclosure’s sophomore record Caracal and lent Mura Masa her vocals too) she’s been gearing up to a big release since 2014, and now that she’s got an album of 18 off-kilter jazz numbers on the table, she’s taking it on tour.

During the UK leg of her tour she’s dropping into Bristol’s Motion on Tuesday 1st November, before she jets off to tour Europe, then Australia and New Zealand in the New Year. If you haven’t had a chance to listen to For All We Know yet, I’d highly recommend you put an hour aside for it. NAO is an incredibly skilled vocalist, and the tricks that you hear on the album are 100% her, playing with her voice in her trademark ‘wonky funk’ style. Seeing her live now, with the chance to hear most of For All We Know live, is a chance not to be missed. She’s going to keep getting better and better, and some of these songs are likely to become rarely played gems.
