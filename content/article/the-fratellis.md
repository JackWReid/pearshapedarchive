It's not often you get a musical group so unassumingly popular as Glaswegian rock group The Fratellis. Known for their highly successful breakthrough album, Costello Music, which included one of their most well known tunes, Chelsea Dagger, they are set to embark on a tour marking the 10th anniversary of their debut. Characterised by energetic beats, thick layered riffs and spirited vocals, they’re reminiscent of classic Brit-rock goodness but with stylised country and jazz overtones.

They’ll be down at Bristol’s O2 Academy, just a short train ride away from Exeter, on the 3rd of December to bang out a few fan favourites from the debut. Whilst it's being advertised as a Costello Music revisit, audiences will hopefully also be treated to newer hits from 2015 album Eyes Wide Tongue Tied -such as Me and the Devil and Baby Don’t You Lie to Me. If you’re looking for a loud, peppy, and slightly sweaty night, this’ll definitely be it.
