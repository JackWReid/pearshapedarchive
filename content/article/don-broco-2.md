Alternative rock band Don Broco have a unique and often un-comparable sound, making music with a contagious beat. They draw on rock/metal influences and then pair this with indie vocals, a winning combination which is quite possibly the reason for their high level of success in 2012 with their debut album, Priorities. Since then, the band released Automatic in 2015 and have been regularly performing it around the country.  They've played festivals such as Reading and Leeds last year, but also Download Festival this summer. They have even played at our very own Lemon Grove here at the University last year.

Their high energy music is incredibly fitting for a live performance, and having seen them live myself, I would definitely recommend you don't pass up the opportunity. They will be playing in Bristol on 15th and 16th August at The Marble Factory. Excuse the terrible pun, but I would ‘automatically’ say yes to buying myself a ticket and so should you!
