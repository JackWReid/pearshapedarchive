Casablanca are set to make an impact with Tom Maccoll, drummer of the band following in the footsteps of his brother Jamie who plays guitar for Bombay Bicycle Club. Their style is typically indie, and whilst this genre fits a broad range of artists Casablanca have managed to stand out from the crowd. Jacob Wheldon, the frontman of the group leads the band with a confidence and swagger that is sure to put him in good stead for the future. The guitarists Tom Herzberg and Callum Alkass – lead guitarist and bassist respectively emit an enthusiasm from the stage that is contagious for the audience. Not only are they producing seriously catchy guitar riffs, but simultaneously having an awesome time.

Furthermore, Casablanca are set to release a new single called We Could Forever which impresses with an opening in similar method to Peace, and an anthem like chorus alla One Night Only. I’m not sure if it is coincidence or not, but the lead singer of Peace, Harry Koisser features in the rather eccentric video containing muffin making and rabbits in a car garage (seriously!) for the song, and George Craig (One Night Only lead) filled in for drums when the band played the ‘BBC Introducing’ stage at Reading/Leeds this year. This is an example of some of the many connections Casablanca have – moreover Jacob has been regularly interviewed on XFM, and the Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens has consistently praised the quartet from Crouch End. Even more impressively, at the youthful ages of 14, the band then known as Lo Fi Culture Scene supported the likes of Bloc Party.

Other songs to listen out for from Casablanca include the incredibly upbeat Hurricane Season and I Needed to Know which has a Kings of Leon feel to it. If you are the sort of person that enjoys following a band just before they hit the big time, I strongly urge you to listen to a few of Casablanca’s songs. If this band was a spaceship they’d be just about ready for lift off. I’ll end on that!
