Bristol raised and based producer Julio Bashmore is set to hit Exeter’s Phoenix for a night that promises soulful garage-house and deep house beats. His latest album, Knockin' Boots, fuses Bashmore’s love of house music with a desire to introduce fans of the genre to its underground French roots. He contends that ‘people have misconstrued what house music is’ – that through contemporary producers’ star-studded obsession with the charts, house music has lost the unique essence which brought the genre into the mainstream to begin with.

In 2010 Bashmore’s distinctive angle on house music paid off following the release of Knockin' Boots. Clubbers, papers and labels alike seemed to catch what the producer has been preaching. As his Facebook page states, “forward-thinking” outlets such as Night Slugs, Ten Thousand Yen, PTN, Dirtybird, fabric and Soul Motive all rushed to house productions and remixes of Bashmore’s material. On Friday the 21st October Exeter will witness first-hand Bashmore’s own increasingly popular take on the genre. Don't miss out.
