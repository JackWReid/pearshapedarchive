It’s going to be a massive homecoming for tropical indie-pop band, Coasts, as they return home to Bristol’s Thekla on June 3rd. A year has passed since the band’s debut album release of their self-titled LP back in January 2016. The debut itself was greatly received thanks to the impressive production team that has already been involved with artists such as Bastille, Two Door Cinema Club, The Kaiser Chiefs and even Adele. Stand-out singles includes the dreamy Oceans which has now reach 4 million listens on SoundCloud alongside personal favourite A Rush of Blood. Altogether, the freshman effort skilfully shuffled a perfectly balanced deck that is anthemic, danceable and uplifting. If you enjoy other up and coming alternative bands like the Hunna, Amber Run or the established Imagine Dragons, you will not be disappointed with their seaside-inspired variety.

However, 2017 has seen the teasing of new material with the allusion a new project ready for “18.08.2017”. New utterings have proceeded the release of 3 new singles that have upped the tropical stakes to a new canopy whilst retaining the bands guitar-centric sound. Characteristically, the band is still breaking away into their carnival of festive riffs in both Heart Starts Beating and the newest single Let Me Love You, released 24th May. Furthermore, Paradise, Coast’s March release, introduces a new dreamy aspect to their exotic sonic repertoire, an exciting addition that has me particularly intrigued for their new work.

Sadly, the Coasts tour is largely sold out, although, there are worthwhile waiting lists on seetickets and fortunately still space for Edinburgh’s The Bongo Club (29th May) or London’s Heaven (5th June). It is a certainty that the Coasts will be present at several festivals over this summer (with a performance already announced for Cornwall’s [LEOPALLOOZA](https://www.facebook.com/leopallooza/)). Let’s hope that with even more material and the rumoured mid-August release that a new, bigger tour will be on the way at a venue near you, in the not too distant future!

Coasts may still be an up and coming band, but I can’t recommend enough the opportunities to catch them soon, in more intimate encounters, before they break out into larger spaces. It’s a matter of when not if.
