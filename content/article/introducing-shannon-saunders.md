I first discovered Shannon Saunders back in 2013, when she was the support act at a tiny Lewis Watson concert I was attending. Since then her style has drastically changed and developed, yet her reign as one of the most talented musicians I know of has been successfully maintained. Moving away from the unarguably incredible acoustic covers she began posting at the age of 14, Saunders is now releasing seriously impressive pop-house tracks, earning herself a well-deserved signing with music mogul Kwame Kwantem of ATC Management last year.

Her music is the perfect blend of catchy lyrics, beautiful vocals and solid dance beats. The production is impressive, expertly tying up otherwise heavy synth sounds with Saunders delicate voice. Despite the move from acoustic songs to dance tracks, Saunders never loses touch with her songwriting talents and somehow manages to create music that you can relate to but also pre to - a little bit like a more mature, techno version of Taylor Swift. Her most recent release Back Around showcases this entirely, with a bouncy dance beat but lyrics such as “You bring me back around / And my head’s up in the clouds / With you”.

If my word alone isn’t enough to convince you, Shannon has also recently been featured on Sunday Brunch, toured with Saint Raymond and has a massive tour with Wilkinson lined up for 2016 - not to mention the song they released together back in 2015, Breathe. Her new album is planned for release this year, so definitely watch this space. I can promise you, you won’t regret it.
