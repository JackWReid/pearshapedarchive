2017 has been a strange year, to say the least. It feels like it's simultaneously 2007 and 2020 at the same time. Disposable cameras and boot cut jeans are back in fashion, the iPhone X is here, and Scouting for Girls released a new album. 8 years ago, if I was told that Scouting for Girls was on tour, I would have been the happiest girl in the world. Over the years, my love for the band has been reserved to guilty pleasure playlists and cheesy nights in. However, now that they're back on tour to celebrate their 10th anniversary, the preteen in me is alive again and more than thrilled to watch them live.

Their tour promises to be appeasing for both old and new fans, with songs off the new albums alongside classic Scouting for Girls anthems. Make your way down to The Great Hall on the University's campus on the 13th of November for a night of nostalgia and throwback hits
