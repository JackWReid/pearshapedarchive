On the 12th of November, the Thekla stage in Bristol will be welcoming Texan singer-songwriters Wade Bowen and Willy Braun. The water-borne venue is the perfect place for the artists to perform an acoustic, intimate gig, showcasing their incredible country song-writing abilities. While this is Bowen’s first tour in the UK, he is a well renowned performer in the States, performing 250 gigs a year after the release of Try Not To Listen in 2002. Since then he has released eight albums, each receiving universal praise within the Texan country scene. His most recent album Then Sings My Soul...Songs For My Mother was originally just intended as a gift for his mother, but received such a good reception that he released the gospel-infused tracks. While some of Bowen’s most popular songs such as Songs About Trucks and Saturday Night will be sure to create a lively atmosphere, I am more excited to hear such a rugged country voice cover traditional hymns in such an intimate setting. I also look forward to hearing the songs of Willy Braun who will be sharing the stage. While perhaps lesser known, Braun shares the same amazing talent in producing poignant, soulful lyrics.

Country may not be everyone’s immediate choice of music genre, but perhaps this is because they have yet to hear a unique live performance of real country songs played just as they should be, by two of Texas’ best. I invite you to come along on the 12th and hear country done well.
