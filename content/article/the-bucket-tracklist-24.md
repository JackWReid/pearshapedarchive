Hello, column, my old friend. After an exam-hiatus, The Bucket Tracklist is officially back up and running, and I’m ready to open my ears, mind and soul to some more classic records. For the 23 weeks this column has been running (which is pretty much longer than I’ve stuck to anything, ever) I’ve been able to listen to some beautiful, thought provoking, sometimes heartbreaking, and sometimes downright funky music. I want to take this week’s column, therefore, to revisit my favourite tracks of these sometimes iconic (and sometimes not) records: the best of the best. Let’s be honest, listening to an album start to finish can be very time consuming, especially if you’re supposed to be focussing on Molecular Biology or International Law or, in my case, Modernist Poetry. Even I must admit that sometimes the reading list is big enough without adding my ramblings to it, and so I present to you 22 tracks that cover the basics of what you might have missed. So sit back, cancel your plans, and set a reminder for every Wednesday so that you never miss another instalment of this column again. Most of all, though, happy listening!
