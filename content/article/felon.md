_**When did you start producing? Was there a particular gig or artist that inspired you to start creating your own music?**_ In terms of production we’ve all come from different backgrounds, but decided to start producing together at the beginning of this year. As a group our early influences vary from Deadmau5, Justice & Liam Howlett.

_**We’re loving your debut track, “Isla,” at the moment. Can you tell us a bit about the process behind the finished product? How long were you working on it for? Where did the samples come from? What software/instruments did you use?**_ We started Isla at the beginning of the Summer, the raw idea was made on Ableton, then flown in to Logic Rig at the studio, where we then reorganized the arrangement and took each sound a lot further. We tend to produce on a mixture of Ableton and Logic, with a vast array of plugins. We’re big fans of Native Instruments Massive, Maschine, Rob Papen SubBoomBass when it comes to synths. Go-to effects include the Waves Suite, Dada Life Sausage Fattener, Speakerphone etc.

_**What do you have planned for the next couple of months? Anything you can tell us about what you’re working on at the moment?**_ We’re currently in the studio working on the EP, which will be out later this year and are looking to gig as much as possible.

_**Isla’s got a lot of jazzy elements to it, we really like the sax stabs and the horn samples that you’ve used. Do you think this is a style that you’ll be building on in the future?**_ You may not necessarily hear any sax across the other tracks, however, we are big fans of using live instruments as much as possible. We were lucky to have The Sax Man aka Ben Barnett come into the studio having played with him at one of our gigs.

_**Who are you listening to at the moment? We’re always on the lookout for new music that our readers would be interested in… Anyone we should be keeping an eye on?**_ Martin Ikin, Marlon Hoffstadt, Lane 8, and Real Connoisseur.

_**Are there any plans to release Isla as a single, or as part of an EP?**_ Currently talking to a number of labels about the release… so watch this space!

_**Any upcoming gigs that you’re involved with? Do you DJ as well as produce?**_ We all played out in Ibiza this Summer, which was amazing from what we can remember! We’re now residents at Troupe London and lots of bookings are popping up… including Why So Serious? in November, Beta Carnival After Party this weekend and in September we will be supporting Waze & Odyssey and Citizen.
