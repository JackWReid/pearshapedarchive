2016 was a rough year for Amber Run. Not only were the band dropped by their label, their drummer Felix Archer left the group. Adding to that was the pressure of releasing an album that could live up to the expectations of fans and critics alike after their breakthrough album 5 AM in 2015. Come 2017, they started the year with a bang. They released their sophomore album, For A Moment, I Was Lost in February of 2017. Much to the band's relief, the new album was well received by listeners.

The album marked the beginning of an era for Amber Run. To commemorate this evolution, they announced their European tour, commencing on the 28th of September at Exeter's very own Lemon Grove. The Nottingham boys promise that their shows will be "sweaty and hot", amongst other things. The venue itself guarantees an intimate performance and close proximity to the band, an experience similar to their album. Amber Run will be accompanied by Indie darlings Seafret. Whether you're veteran fans with vinyls of their albums or have never heard of them before, drop in for a night of good music and an even better atmosphere. Mark your calendars and get your tickets ASAP before they sell out!
