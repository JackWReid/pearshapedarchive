LANY, the California based musical trio, is set to perform at the O2 Academy in Bristol on December 5th 2017 at 7:00 pm. The band’s name is an acronym for “Los Angeles New York” which signifies their truly American background. They were formed in Los Angeles, which has influenced some of their music. The group is made up of Paul Klein, who sings lead vocals and plays keyboard and guitar, Jason Gross, who provides percussion, and Les Priest, who plays keyboard, guitar, and sings backup vocals. The band formed fairly recently in 2014, but has produced a variety of work in their short years together.

The groups sound is a mixture of 80’s pop, 90’s RnB, and electronica. Their music has also been categorized as electropop, dream pop, indie pop, or alternative rock. LANY’s music is a combination of electronic influences and heartfelt lyrics. The electronic influences hark back to earlier eras as well as making the band’s sound futuristic.

LANY has supported a variety of other American indie artists on American tours, including Twin Shadow, Tove Styrke, X Ambassadors, Troye Sivan, and Halsey. More recently in their career, they supported Ellie Goulding on her UK tour as they began to gain popularity of their own. They headlined their first tour in May of 2016, performing at a variety of American festivals including Bonnaroo, Firefly, and Outside Lands. Their second headlining tour – called the “Kinda Tour” - included dates in both the US and the UK. More recent tours have included dates in the US, Asia, Australia, and the UK. Their most recent tour is entirely UK based and runs throughout the winter of 2017. This is to support their debut album, also called LANY, which was released in June of 2017. Although they are a relatively new band, any music fan should jump at the chance to catch this iconic trio in Bristol this upcoming December.
