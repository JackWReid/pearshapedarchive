Fresh from a successful summer playing the festival circuit, Spring King come to Bristol. The quartet, formed in lead singer Tarek Musa's garage during the summer of 2012, describe themselves as “a small-scale, art-pop-punk project” from Manchester. In the following years the band received a vast amount of support from BBC Introducing, providing them with the platform to perform at Latitude, Reading & Leeds and a stateside visit to SXSW.

Spring King’s career came to prominence on 30th June 2015 when former Radio One presenter Zane Lowe opened the inaugural ‘Beats 1’ show on Apple Music with their unreleased single City; which was described as an “absolute headfuck” by Musa. This launched the band’s career from the occasional airplay on BBC Introducing to 100,000 streams on Spotify within a week and numerous record deal offers - Spring King had arrived. They settled with Island Records and released their debut album Tell Me If You Like To in June this year, resulting in an 8/10 review from Clash Magazine.

The band are renowned for their mid-set antics and the occasional onstage vomit from Musa’s passionate yet exhausting performances. You can now catch them for £11 on the penultimate date of their third UK headline tour with support from Get Inuit and Cagoule.
