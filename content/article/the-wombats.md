Despite the burrowing nature of the wombat, UK band The Wombats are anything but shy. Originating in Liverpool, music trio The Wombats have been making music together since 2003. Comprised of vocalist and guitarist Matthew Murphy, drummer Dan Haggis, and guitarist Tord Øverland Knudsen, they make music that mixes genres including rock, indie, pop, punk, and new wave. They have been compared to other indie rock bands like Two Door Cinema Club, The Kooks, The Vaccines, Arctic Monkeys, and The Fratellis. Their synth hooks combined with their catchy lyrics and strong drum beats make for an intriguing, genre-bending experience.

Together, they have released three full studio albums: A Guide to Love, Loss & Desperation, The Modern Glitch, and Glitterbug. Their next record, Beautiful People Will Ruin Your Life, is set to be released in 2018, for which their UK tour is based around. During their early years they also produced some limited-release albums, the first of which was only available in Japan. The Wombat’s have sold over 1 million albums worldwide and they have been nominated for a variety of awards and won for their tune Let’s Dance to Joy Division at the NME Awards.

The Wombats are set to perform on Wednesday March 28th, 2018 at 7 pm at the O2 Academy in Bristol. With their upbeat tunes and catchy lyrics, their live shows are sure to resemble an immense dance party.
