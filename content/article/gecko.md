On Wednesday 24th of October, Exeter Phoenix will host not just your average singer, but a self- proclaimed ‘singer-storyteller reptilian musician’. Gecko, a North London based artist, is currently embarking on a UK based tour throughout October, supported by poetry slam champion Daniel Piper. He is stopping off at the likes of Birmingham, Glasgow and Cambridge before reaching Exeter for his third to last show.

His debut album Volcano, released last November, was named Album Of The Year by the Morning Star, and Gecko certainly has an erupting future ahead of him. Having already performed alongside Ed Sheeran, Lee “Scratch” Perry and Billy Bragg, he has also done two shows at the Edinburgh fringe and an impressive sixteen at Glastonbury. He has received recognition from BBC Radio 1, Radio 6, Radio X and BBC Introducing. His name is not one to forget- so it’s a good job it’s pretty memorable.

At first glance, Gecko is just a normal looking guy, guitar in hand. However, his lyrical talent is anything but ordinary. He categorises his genre as ‘lizard-y lyrical wizardry’ and his music is a hybrid of spoken word and acoustic, easy-going singing. Writing largely about modern-day society, songs such as iPhone, Therefore I Am consist of witty, poetic lyrics and a catchy beat. His music masters the art of laughing at our generation in a sophisticated and artistic manner, whilst maintaining a feel-good vibe. Other creations of his include We’ll Get There, written from the perspective of a panda in a zoo; clearly, Gecko isn’t one for the typical love song. You won’t be able to get his lyrical magic out of your head- perhaps that’s where the ‘wizardry’ comes from.

If you’ve an interest in spoken word, poetry, or just live music and a good laugh, head to The Phoenix on the 24th and check Gecko out. He’ll be sure to put a smile on your face.
