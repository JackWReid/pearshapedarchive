Deserved comparisons to Bon Iver are few and far between, yet the troubadour is playing the Exeter Phoenix on the May 26th. (Alternatively, catch them in Bristol at the Lantern on May 19th). He deserves such a weighty comparison. Luke Sital-Singh is a London singer-songwriter, who has also been compared to Damien Rice and Fleet Foxes, will be touring his second album, which will be released on May 12th. Sital-Singh, though he has slipped under a lot of people’s radar, rose to relative prominence in 2012 following the release of his first EP Fail for You. From this first EP, it could be seen what Sital-Singh is about. His soulful, raw voice and intelligent lyrics taking centre stage with minimal accompaniment. This could sound sparse, but his music is so subtly and intelligently arranged. His follow up EPs have pushed his voice to its limits. At the same time, his music has stayed very true to what he knows and what works. His EP The Breakneck Speed of Tomorrow teased a new direction for his music. However, the first song from his new album, Killing Me, suggests a return to his original music type, though one of the pre-released tracks Hunger does suggest a more rounded, mature artist.

As an artist with such a good voice and such an emphasis on it in his music, seeing him live seems a great opportunity. This isn’t going to be a high-energy concert with mosh pits and everyone going a little bit mental, but for an atmospheric evening of music from a fairly minimalist but talented singer-songwriter, this should be well-worth hearing.
