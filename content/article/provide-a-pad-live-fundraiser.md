On the 19th of January, PearShaped Magazine are excited to be hosting a fundraiser with our friends at Poltimore Festival for Provide A Pad. Provide A Pad are a student led campaign who raise awareness about homeless menstruation and collect sanitary products for donation. To be on your period whilst being homeless doesn’t bear thinking about — and that’s the problem. Despite being a small city, Exeter has the biggest homeless community outside of London, a third of whom are women; and with transgender and non-binary homelessness on the rise, many more homeless people may have to deal with menstruation.

Our fundraiser will feature music from Cara Ludlow, Pattern Pusher, and our headliner, Alice Jemima. Alice Jemima has gone from strength to strength in the past year. As well as captivating crowds at Radio 1’s Big Weekend, Bestival, and Beautiful Days, she has released some of her best singles yet. Expect luscious electronic instrumentation, beautifully coupled with her distinctive breathy vocals and catchy melodies. With support from synth-pop art rockers Pattern Pusher, as well as the emotive folk songwriting of Cara Ludlow, this is shaping up to be a night to remember.

Tickets are £5, or just £3 if you come with a donation of pads or tampons. Buy them below.
