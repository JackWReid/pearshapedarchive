**Our House**

Having started in June 2012, Our House have developed a reputation for hosting some of the best electronic dance nights in the city. Last year they were host to Royal T, Maison Sky, and Dusky, all big names to be brought into Exeter. Their resident DJs are also amongst the most popular in the student community. Their next event is on Tuesday 15th September where we see them takeover the Exeter Brewery playing host to Shanti Celeste.

**Exit**

[Exit](http://pearshapedexeter.com/introducing-exit/) are the go-to night if you want something more than your standard 120bpm house music. Priding themselves on being the “anti-house music” promoters, their bookings usually feature a mix of UK garage, bass, and grime. Last year we saw them bring Bassboy, Notion, and Swamp 81’s [Mickey Pearce](http://pearshapedexeter.com/mickey-pearce-headlines-exit/) to the city and personally, I am looking forward to seeing what they have in store for us this year. Their next event is the Exit Re-Launch at Cavern on Monday 21st September, getting us ready for the year ahead.

**Up And Coming**

Up And Coming aren’t exactly what they say on the tin. Last year they brought Redlight to the Lemmy and Toyboy and Robin to Timepiece, both very established acts in the house music scene. Following an impressive set of bookings last year we should be expecting big things this year. With their residence playing mainly house and techno, their nights are always filled with solid beats and interesting shapes being thrown on the dance floor. Catch Youan at their Freshers’ Week Launch at Cavern on September 16th.

**Fokus**

Probably the newest night in Exeter, Fokus’ launch was last February where they started with a bang and put on Metrik at The Phoenix. They also brought the bass legends Cause and Affect and Monki to Exeter towards the end of the year. Already announced is Big Narstie (October 3rd) and, before then, My Nu Leng at The Phoenix on 25th September, which will be a night not to miss.

**Beats & Bass**

Beats and Bass are the university’s own dance music society and club night (a society I would thoroughly recommend joining – members get discount on a range of events throughout the year including the regular DJ Showcases put on by all the promoters above, as well as their own nights and a number of UK festivals). On International Woman’s Day last year they brought Madam X to Cavern. They also played host to Split Prophets, which was one of the weirdest/best experiences of my Exeter Uni career so far! Nothing has been announced for this year as yet but expect good things coming your way soon.

**Mahatma Music**

Mahatma Music is again a step away from the house music scene that is dominating our live scene at the moment. They formed with the aim of expanding the Exeter clubbing scene to include more live bands, and last year alone they put on Youth Club, The Bulletproof Bomb, The Carnabys, and many more, all at Cavern. Their resident DJs play an eclectic mix with genre-spanning sets and certainly make a change from two stepping in ironic t-shirts and skinny jeans. Nothing has been announced for the upcoming year but make sure you check them out for something a bit different when they do return.

**Thick As Thieves**

This coming year will prove a make-or-break year for Thick As Thieves, I feel. Since The Cellar Door (where they hosted all their nights) closing, they have yet to find a home elsewhere in the city. TaT started in November 2011 and strive to bring the best underground electronic music to the city. Last year they played host to [Waze and Odyssey](http://pearshapedexeter.com/thick-as-thieves-2nd-birthday-with-waze-odyssey/), and Ejeca. Of course, they are also the founders of the brilliant [Hijacked Festival](http://pearshapedexeter.com/hijacked-festival-2015-2/) (though unfortunately they outsourced the bar and that queue was a pretty dark moment in my life). It would be sad to loose TaT; there has been nothing announced for the year ahead but we can only hope they have something in the pipework.

**Hold It Down**

Last but not least we have [Hold It Down](http://pearshapedexeter.com/hold-it-down/). They have come out all guns blazing this year and have shot out a number of massive bookings already. If you’re reading this, I imagine it’s because you have some interest in going out this year and if you somehow manage to avoid a Hold It Down night, you’re not doing it properly. Last year they brought us Hannah Wants (with tickets selling out faster than any event at the Phoenix ever), the twice chart topping DnB duo Sigma, and the brilliant DJ EZ (as part of the Garage Nation tour). Their next event is Kurupt FM at The Lemon Grove (which I can’t encourage you to go to enough) and they are also hosting the Basement Jaxx in the Garden event, which is set to be a fantastic day to close Freshers’ Week. As I previously mentioned, they have already released a number of massive bookings so go check them out as tickets are going very quickly to a lot of them already.
