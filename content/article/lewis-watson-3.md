If supporting lesser-known acts who are completely deserving of big time fame is your thing, then take a listen to Lewis Watson. At 24, the folk-pop singer-songwriter has been backed by the likes of Ed Sheeran and Birdy, with Gabrielle Aplin even featuring on one of his first EPs. His popular single Into The Wild was featured on Made In Chelsea and attracted a huge new following, garnering enough of a buzz to get record companies in on the Lewis Watson hype too. In 2012 he signed a deal with Warner Bros. Records, going on to release his first album, The Morning, in 2013 to great critical success.

It doesn’t stop there though. Moving away from Warner Bros. and signing to independent label Cooking Vinyl, Lewis’ second album, Midnight, is due for release on the 24th March: we can undoubtedly expect even more beautifully heartfelt lyrics and soft acoustic guitar sounds. To tie in with the new album Lewis is also heading out on tour, taking a stop at Bristol’s Thekla on the day Midnight is released. A Lewis Watson gig is undeniably an emotional rollercoaster. You’ll be moved by the sincerity and feeling in his songs, but then you’ll be laughing at the easy interaction he has with his dedicated crowd. What is most impressive, however, is Lewis’ musical ability: luckily his genuine talent is not lost at all in the transfer from CD to live performance.

Lewis Watson is one of music’s hidden treasures – for now. Don’t miss out on seeing him perform in venues as intimate as Thekla while you still can.
