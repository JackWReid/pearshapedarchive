Singer-songwriter Joana Serrat from Vic, Spain, will be gracing Exeter Phoenix as part of her UK Tour on the 26th of January. Joana first found great success on her 2014 album Dear Great Canyan and her recent album Cross the Verge is a continuation, if not maturation, of her singer-songwriting abilities. She collaborated with Grammy nominee Howard Bilerman (nominated for his work on Arcade Fire’s Funeral) on this album and his American indie folk influence is subtly inherent in the tracks. Joana’s style of music can only be described as unique: a fusion of 90’s indie rock, pop and American folk, each track exploring each one of these styles whilst exploring different emotions and telling different stories. It is with no surprise that Rolling Stone France claims that Joana’s voice has the ability to “open you up to a new world, a world of dreams and smooth and silken atmospheres”. She has the ability to captivate her audience with only her guitar and soft, hauntingly ethereal voice that is paired so naturally with her emotive and genuine lyrics. A sense of fragility and preciousness is present in her music, which is nothing but endearing and alluring - critics have claimed her performances to be a "pleasure to watch".

If you’re in the mood to be moved and taken by raw and genuine talent, Joana’s gig at Exeter Phoenix is one not to be missed.
