_**What would you say your ‘sound’ is?**_ Rock ’n’ roll. _\[We joke about his ‘The Boat that Rocked’ dress sense and John Lennon glasses\]_

_**Is this biggest gig you’ve done?**_ Tonight was probably equal to the biggest crowd we’ve played. We’ve played for Teignmouth Carnival which was quite a lot of people, but these people had it tonight.

_**Tell us a little about your new EP.**_ Our new EP is out and we produced it ourselves. We’re proud of it, but we’re gonna be working with a better producer soon.

_**What would you say your music is about?**_ Real life stuff. Real life stuff that you see at the weekend. We see a LOT of stuff at the weekend…

_**Where do you see yourself being in the next 10 months as a band?**_ Lovin’ life.

_**Apart from that?**_ Probably signed.

_**Who would you love to be signed with?**_ EMI, Sony - no one shit! Aiming big!

_**If you could collaborate with anyone, who would it be?**_ John Lennon. Paul Weller.

_**Who would your idol be?**_ Well it used to be Pete Doherty but we were supporting his gig and he didn’t turn up. So probably Paul Weller or John Lennon.
