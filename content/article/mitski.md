Mitski Miyawaki (stage name Mitski) comes to Thekla on the 7th of March. She’s a unique voice in music today, harnessing the raw power of Strange Mercy era St Vincent, the fragile sadness of Julie Byrne, and the punk energy of bands like Weezer.

Her most recent album, Puberty 2, tackled the subjects of sex, gender, race, maturity, and countless others with consummate skill; the complex political poetry of the lyrics encased in moments of musical brilliance. There’s the industrial train-chug percussion in Happy, the slow-burning thud of Once More to See You, and the furious explosion when the chorus in Your Best American Girl hits. There’s the unrelenting clamour of 100 second My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars. There’s the ominous, woozy Crack Baby, and, at the end of it all, the beautiful, exhausted come-down of A Burning Hill.

Hits from her previous three albums are sure to make an appearance too, making this a night not to be missed for all fans of intelligent, heartfelt punk-rock.
