The 'nu-rave' subculture (2007-2008) was derided by critics, with acts such as Hadouken! validly being described as advocates of simple music bordering on the banal. The Klaxons, despite describing the moniker as ironic, were tarred with the same brush. By the time their second album had finally been released after years of difficulty, their time had gone. Whether one can blame their subculture, the media or a mere lack of quality, it is unlikely they will ever become a heavy weight in music culture. However, their debut album Myths Of The Near Future, linked inextricably to the 'nu-rave' fad whether they like it or not, is a forgotten classic. One that should not be ignored however, due to its complexity, originality, and influence.

It takes approximately three songs to affirm that The Klaxons are not operating in the same sphere of musicality as their 2007 counterparts. Their influences are wide, with angular guitar and bass riffs reminiscent of Silent Alarm era Bloc Party, shrieking 80s falsetto, covers of rave classics (check out their cover of The Bouncer by Kicks Like A Mule) and lyrical content that betrays a vast arsenal of cultural allusion. The frequent use of multiple melodies means though simple individually, the separate parts form a complex whole, exhibited in the polyphonic climaxes of As Above So Below and Two Receivers.

If this all sounds a bit Everything Everything to you, key to the albums appeal is just how catchy it is. James Righton told bowienet in 2007 how David Bowie was a great influence, how “you can’t ever say what Bowie truly sounds like”, and this ambiguity is present here. Yet, tracks such as Atlantis to the Interzone and Golden Skans are unforgettable, especially their prominent riffs. It is a testament to The Klaxons willingness to innovate that their Myspace description; “Psychedelic / Progressive / Pop” is clearly audible, along with unmistakable usage of other genres. So whether you brand them with Hadouken! or not, stream the sublime Myths Of The Near Future, an intellectual’s rave album.
