Jake Bugg is set to perform at Colston Hall in Bristol on Saturday February 24th. Colston Hall is the largest music venue in Bristol, catering to music from all genres, including pop, folk, jazz, rock, and classical. The acoustics of the large-scale venue are sure to enhance Bugg’s already enchanting voice to an unforeseen level. As Bugg is performing a solo acoustic set, his raw vocals and guitar skills will be highlighted. He was raised on classic artists such as the Beatles, Oasis, and Jimi Hendrix, some of which inspire his current music. Bugg’s tunes mix rock, folk, and include a hint of a country twang at times.

The British artist is native to Nottingham and is currently on a solo United Kingdom tour. He started his music career at the tender age of 18, releasing a self-titled album in 2012. Bugg has since released three more studio albums: Shangri La, On My One, and Hearts that Strain. Prior to the release of his first studio album Bugg performed at Glastonbury in 2011 and wrote songs for several commercials. His music has also been featured in several movies, including The Fault in Our Stars. Bugg has performed as a supporting act for several big names like Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds and worked with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Up and coming singer-songwriter Georgie, also from Nottingham, will open for Bugg at Colston Hall. Her sound has been described to mimic artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Carole King, Janis Joplin, and First Aid Kit. Her vocals are as captivating as Bugg’s, making her an excellent opener who is bound to keep the audience spellbound. The combination of the two singer-songwriters will appeal to lovers of folk and rock, but also to anyone who appreciates intelligent songwriting and raw vocals.
