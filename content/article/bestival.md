The updated Bestival line-up has just been released. New additions include Glass Animals and Crystal Fighters in the Big Top, and Sean Paul and Wiz Khalifa, two Billboard Hot 100 chart toppers, taking to the Main Stage on the Sunday to bring the jam-packed weekend of music, partying, and raving to an exuberant end.  
  
This truly is a festival to suit every music taste, with dancehall, hip-hop, R&B, reggae, grime, and dance music to name a few. A quick scan of the line-up shows an incredibly wide variety of acts - just in the first day the Main Stage will host Damien Marley, Years & Years, Skepta, and Major Lazer.  
  
As for surprises in store, there are sure to be many. Bestival has announced that it will be holding an “audio-visual fireworks spectacular” in tribute to the legendary Prince to close the festival on a high.  
  
The theme of the festival this year is The Future. Bestival 'rave-master' Rob da Bank has enlisted the help of several set designers and Paul Normandale (lighting designer to Bjork and Coldplay) to build the Spaceport, a rocket ready for a rave. Make sure to bring plenty of glitter, face-paint, and futuristic garms to be a part of the theme.  
  
If you need a break from the music, Bestival will be home to a “host of electic treats”, with a range of other activities including circus performances, comedy shows, poetry slams, theatre, and even knitting workshops. Bestival has even created the world’s biggest bouncy castle. Measuring an insane 23.8 metres long and 20.7 metres wide, with a height of 12.8 metres at its highest point, it’s taller than the Great Wall of China and roughly three times bigger than the Berlin Wall!  
  
Finally, my favourite thing to talk about - food! With winners from the Best of the Best at the 2015 British Street Food Awards, Bestival will have a plenty of choice, including gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, and raw options for those with dietary requirements.  
  
In a beautiful location, Bestival is seemingly a carnival packed into a forest. So if you’re searching for a way to end the summer on a high note before getting dragged down with the inevitable coursework and deadlines, Bestival is the perfect solution.
