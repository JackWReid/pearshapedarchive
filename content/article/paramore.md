Last year, rumours started flying about a potential upcoming Paramore album and tour. Instagram posts were scrutinised, tweets went viral, and fans took shifts monitoring the band’s Facebook page. Well, now, it’s here.

Paramore’s fifth album, After Laugher, will drop on 12th May and the band have already released a brand new single titled Hard Times. The 80s inspired, retro-pop sound stems from their previous hits Still Into You and Ain’t It Fun to solidify the band’s new direction. Up-beat and bold, Hard Times comes with a vibrant new music video.

To celebrate the launch of their new album, Paramore are taking on what they are terming 'Tour One' which will see them travel around the UK, Ireland and Europe. They’re stopping off at Bristol’s Colston Hall on 21st June.

The venues for this tour are unique in their small capacities, suggesting that this is special opportunity to experience an intimate Paramore concert. For the south-west and Paramore fans alike, this is sure to be an incredible chance to see the hugely successful band in their element, with the recently returned Zac Farro.
