_**Congratulations on the lovely new EP! How do you feel about all the positive response from the fans and critics?**_

It's always a pleasure to here nice things about your work. But in all honesty we don't pay too much attention to positive or negative press. We enjoyed making it and it felt like a positive challenge and that's the most important thing.

_**After the success of your debut album, the band hit a bit of a rough patch. How have you evolved as a group and how has that reflected on your album? **_

It helped us garner perspective and understand why we were making music. We started to allow ourselves to enjoy the process more which I think has helped us to become a better recording band and live outfit.

_**What are your favourite tracks off of the album and why?**_

Fickle Game is a personal favourite of mine because it's a really truthful song. It's feels as potent now as the day we wrote it.

_**In a recent interview you said that For A Moment I Was Lost was born from a place of hardship. How do you feel about performing songs from the album live? **_

Some of them can be tough - but we love playing live so that's normally the overriding feeling. Live music is the best thing on the planet.

_**What are you most looking forward to on tour?**_

Seeing and meeting fans that we haven't seen or met before. We made a really conscious effort to play these shows in places we don't go too often or haven't been to ever

_**How different do you expect this tour to be from all the previous ones you've done?**_

Hopefully there’ll be some new faces in the crowd!

_**From studying at University of Nottingham, to doing a headlining tour. Did you ever anticipate the fame and stardom that you have today?**_

We always knew that we could take this band as far as we ourselves would let it. I wouldn't say it feels like game or stardom yet but thanks for the compliment!

_**Would you say that fame has changed you in any way, positive or negative?**_

I wouldn't say so. We enjoy what we do but we live in the real world!

_**If you could go back in time, what advice would you give to your 17-year-old self?**_

Enjoy what you do and realise that sometimes dreams need hard work and time to materialise.

_**Finally, what are your expectations from the year ahead?**_

Playing lots of shows and playing in loads of towns, country's and continents that we've never been before. It's going to be a fun ride.
