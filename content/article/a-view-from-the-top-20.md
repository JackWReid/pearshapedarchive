Following weeks and weeks of teen heartthrobs taking the top spot (Bieber, followed by Shawn Mendes, followed by Zayn Malik…), I was more than happy to see that Danish group Lukas Graham have maintained their position at Number 1 for the second week running.

The piano driven melody of 7 Years is a welcome breath of fresh air amongst the heavily synthesised and bass focused songs found below it in the Top 40. Its clever and nostalgic lyrics about the stages of life means that it stands completely in opposition to those of Zayn’s sexual Pillowtalk, but that doesn’t make it boring. The harmless lyrics and gentle melody mean that everyone can relate to the song to some extent, making it one of those rare songs that is loved by people of all ages. The lyrics are a definite selling point, and there is no doubt that part of the reason it has done so well is the catchiness of its chorus. Even if you only hear the song once and absolutely hate it, you are 100% guaranteed to have “Once I was seven years old” stuck in your head for the next twenty-four hours – whether you like it or not.

Despite this, I’m not sure I can see 7 Years lasting another week in the top spot, although I wouldn’t mind being proven wrong just to ensure Shawn Mendes’ Stitches doesn’t sneak its way back up there. After the fifth listen through, and what feels like the fiftieth time I’ve heard it on the radio, it definitely loses its nostalgic magic and gets a bit repetitive. Having then sat through a two hour seminar with the chorus stuck in my head, I wasn’t actually sure I could ever listen to it again. Whilst it is a nice song, that’s basically all it is – I don’t think there is anything special enough about it to ensure it remains at Number 1 for a third week.

In Number 3 this week, just behind Zayn’s Pillowtalk, is Rihanna’s newest release and lead single off of her new album, Work. I’m not the biggest Rihanna fan in the world but I really love this song, and there is no doubt that it is ridiculously catchy and deserves to do well. Considering that Drake is featured and it’s guaranteed to be played in just about every club everywhere, it’s a massive surprise that it didn’t go straight to Number 1. The charts are clearly filled with surprises this week as the Jonas Blue and Dakota remix of Fast Car is somehow still in the Top 5. The sheer destruction of Chapman’s beautiful lyrics to produce a song that is only decidedly average is something that I can’t quite wrap my head around.

Following the tragic deaths of the band and their manager earlier this week, Viola Beach make an entry at Number 11 with Swings & Waterslides. Even without the tragic reason behind its sudden surge in popularity, Swings & Waterslides fully deserves its position in the Top 40. It is a well-written, catchy song, with an impressive use of guitar and a good beat. The reason that so many people are just now discovering their music is heart-breaking, and it is a massive shame that none of their music charted sooner. Definitely give it a listen when you have a chance.
