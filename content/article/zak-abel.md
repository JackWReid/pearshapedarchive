With his soulful and individualistic voice, 22-year old English singer/songwriter and musician Zak Abel’s music has touched many hearts. In such a short span of time, he has already collaborated with producers like Kaytranada and Wookie, has toured Europe and has been featured in Vogue’s ’50 Fittest Boys of 2017′. His music is appropriate for any mood, and diversity is the most beautiful part of his creations. You can dance your troubles away to Still Want UUU and listen to Deserve to be loved when all things goes south. Zak started his music career just at the age of 16 and from his debut EP Joker Presents released in 2015, to his singles Everybody Needs Love and Unstable released in 2016, this young and talented artist, has come a long long way to 2017, and released his brilliantly crafted debut album Only When We’re Naked, which effortlessly gained a spot in UK’s top 100 albums chart. Each and every song on this dynamic album is inspired by his experiences and blended with a vibe of African sounds. His music rejuvenates the sounds of the 70’s funk and rhythm and his passion for making music reflects in all his songs. His collaborations with Avicii, Tom Misch and Wretch 32 has gained a lot of recognition. Unmissable by Gorgon City featuring Zak, gained a #19 spot on the UK singles chart, #5 on UK Dance chart, and #16 in Scotland!

To witness his magic, humour and charisma live, there is no better chance than going for his live show in Bristol! If you fancy listening to something really unique and raw, with an addition to amazing and strong vocals, Zak Abel’s gig will be the perfect plan for a midweek escape!
