Halloween, the sign post that we are around half way through term, and also an excellent excuse to through a party, even if any sense of meaning has been lost through the years. It nonetheless gives us a great reason to put together a diverse and somewhat eclectic collection of songs, though all equally as eerie and fitting to the theme.

As with Christmas, there are many commercial songs that are synonymous with celebrating the festivities, whether it be Rockwells’ Somebody’s Watching Me, The Addams Family theme tune or MJs Thriller. Whilst here at Pearshaped we have tried to be somewhat original with our picks, we have thrown in some cliché ‘treats’ for good measure. But, be wary, as this is a playlist unlike most. Featuring Boards of Canada, David Bowie, Warpaint, Poe, Kanye West, Childish Gambino, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and of course Bobby Pickett, there’s sure to be something for everyone.

So, get your obligatory fancy dress on, your pumpkins lit and the drinks prepared, cause we’ve got the music sorted for you.
