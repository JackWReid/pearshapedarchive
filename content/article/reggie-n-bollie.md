When Reggie and Bollie got through to the final of 2015’s X Factor, the world didn’t quite know how to react. On the one hand, the Ghanaian duo comprised of Reggie Zippy and Bollie Babyface (yes, really) are seemingly lovely, genuine guys who just want to entertain us. On the other hand, they absolutely and completely cannot sing.

It was unsurprising, therefore, that they lost out on the X Factor win to someone who could actually hold the tune of Bob Dylan’s Forever Young, the winner’s single that year. While their loss wasn’t unexpected, it was mourned by fans all over the world, who were interested in seeing an X Factor ‘joke act’ go all the way. Their loss didn’t stop them for long, with a brand new single New Girl in the charts just months later which peaked at 26. The opening lyric of "I got the Netflix, if you got the chill" established Reggie and Bollie as good time guys who don’t take themselves too seriously. They are, therefore, the perfect act to be kicking off this year’s Freshers' Week. They play The Lemon Grove Monday 12th, with tickets an absolute steal at £6. As if the promise of Ghanaian dance tunes wasn’t enough, the whole evening is a beach party. In other words, this gig is the perfect way to pretend summer isn’t over just yet. Reggie and Bollie may not be the best singers in the world, but they definitely know how to put on a show.
