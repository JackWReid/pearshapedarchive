Our House kicked off fresher’s week with a slightly different event than usual and the risk paid off. Their two-part all-day all-night party, which started at the Exeter Brewery, was a great success. The weather luckily held out and there was a chilled atmosphere, the music initially matching this relaxed vibe. The usual Our House residents delivered great sets, with Matt Lloyd kicking things off, although the day began with a slow start; the venue was sparsely occupied but people began to trickle in things picked up.

It was surreal to be going into what was essentially a large car park in the Brewery, however the Our House team had put in an amazing effort to transform it and decorate it well. The food was fantastic and the local beer was a great edition to the day; it basically had the set-up of a mini-festival. It was a nice way of enjoying the last of the summer weather.

Shanti Celeste delivered a great set. I like her combination of alluring yet funky beats and I thought that Our House made a great choice getting her down for the day party. Her set was impressive and really lively - so much so that she's now gone on to kick up a storm in Bristol. Everybody slowly left and started heading over to Cavern for the second part of the Our House event. (A shout out must go to Harry Gordon for playing Horny during his set, which wrapped up the day nicely).

Dan Shake was the after party guest in Cavern and Our House did what they always do best by creating a great atmosphere. He played a surprising set with some interesting tracks and the dancefloor was the busiest I have seen at Cavern for a long time. This is hopefully a sign of what’s to come and Our House have an exciting year ahead with some great acts to follow.
