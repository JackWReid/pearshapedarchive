Mura Masa will be big. Catch him at a small venue while you still can! Alex Crossan, as he’s otherwise known, started making his own music and beats on his laptop at home in Guernsey, aged 16. Being only 20 now, his career has quickly spiralled upwards.

After moving to the mainland to study at the University of Sussex in Brighton, he started to perform live and was selling out gigs in both Brighton and London before formally releasing any music. Radio 1 were quick to pick up on his emergence on the scene and his track Lotus Eater was played by Zane Lowe, Annie Mac and Huw Stephens. Firefly then got added to the In New Music We Trust playlist, and Mura then finished 5th in the BBC’s Sound of 2016.

With one mixtape and one EP having been released so far, it's widely believed the debut album is on its way. Love For That and What If I Go? are looking likely to be the first singles, having been released earlier this year. What If I Go? has been particularly successful, having been played on Made in Chelsea, but Mura still hasn’t had a song in the Top 40. He must be hoping he gets there soon, and I for one think that he definitely will - I was surprised to read he hadn’t already.

He’ll take comfort in the fact that his live shows are so popular though. With a sold-out crowd and an incredible atmosphere, the idea of Mura Masa playing at Thekla (an old cargo ship docked at Bristol’s Floating Harbour) is one that almost gets me salivating.
