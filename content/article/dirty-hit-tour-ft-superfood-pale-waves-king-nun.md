Fun-loving indie rockers Superfood are making a comeback with their second record after a sizeable break since their 2014 debut Don’t Say That. According to frontman Dom Ganderton in a recent DIY Magazine [interview](http://diymag.com/2017/02/07/in-the-studio-superfood-2017-dirty-hit), the album is “completed and ready to be released to the world”. The Brummies kick off their return to music with a headline slot in Dirty Hit’s first ever annual tour, taking place this spring and boasting a whopping seventeen dates. With the announcement that they will be playing some new songs on the tour, this is a must-attend for Superfood fans!

Dirty Hit is a West London label that has been made famous thanks to their signed acts The 1975, Wolf Alice and Benjamin Francis Leftwich – a pretty impressive repertoire. It is Dirty Hit newbies King Nun and Pale Waves who will be taking the support act slots and it is sure to be an eclectic night, with the former band’s hyperactive, shouty, indie-verging-on-punk style and the latter’s only song online showcasing some dreamy guitar pop.

Superfood’s signing to Dirty Hit seems to have come as a timely stroke of luck, with Dom recalling that the band had “no studio, no money (and) no label” at the beginning of the writing cycle for the new album. Despite these gloomy circumstances, however, the band are happy to have had more time to write this record in contrast to their debut, giving them an opportunity to experiment with new sounds. The first single from the album was released earlier this month and gives us a hint of what is to come.

Dirty Hit have an ear for talent and they have the stars to prove it. Make sure to get down to Bristol on the 30th March as this celebration of new talent will be the perfect way to celebrate the end of term.
