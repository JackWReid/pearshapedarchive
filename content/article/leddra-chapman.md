Leddra Chapman is set to grace Exeter’s Phoenix with her beautiful voice and song-writing skills this November as the final show in The Third Love Tour. The tour will be showcasing her new EP tracks which have been much anticipated. Whilst not a huge name herself, Leddra’s work has received much critical appreciation. She has previously written and performed with Ed Sheeran, and more recently co-written with Matt Cardle.

Within the past seven years, Leddra’s music has seen huge development. While she may still be best known as a folky singer-songwriter musician, as seen in her guitar and piano driven album Telling Tales, her more recent releases have shown a complete change to more of a pop, electronic influence. However, the teasers for the new EP released on her Facebook page seem to hint that the ‘old’ Leddra is back. An acoustic version of new song Perfect Distraction has been released on YouTube and is definitely reminiscent of her older, emotional, piano accompanied songs. The title track of the EP seems to show that the next release will be a combination of new and old. The song has a definite pop influence, but also highlights her vocal capabilities in a much stronger way than more recent work. Her performance at Phoenix, therefore, will definitely be one to look forward to. I am excited to hear her new tracks and appreciate her really clever song-writing skills. Hopefully she will also include some of her classically amusing songs such as Fallen from Grace, which are always sure to entertain a crowd.
