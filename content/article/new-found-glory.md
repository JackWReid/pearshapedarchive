New Found Glory will play at the O2 Academy in Bristol on October 5th at 7:00 pm. Their performance is a celebration of their 20 years together, which means that they will play their greatest hits from previous albums, such as Sticks & Stones and Catalyst. Expect to hear some old favorites with some newer material that channels the group’s previous work.

The pop-punk movement is still alive and well with American band New Found Glory, as evidenced in their latest release, Makes Me Sick_._ Holistically, Makes Me Sick follows its genre’s footsteps, as it explores love in, heartbreak, and troubles of modern life in the same sound we all remember from the early to mid-2000s bands such as All-American Rejects. The sound is bound to create an easy-going and dance-friendly concert environment, as it channels pop punk’s staple catchy combination of drums, guitar, and catchy lyrical hooks. The Sound of Two Voices, in particular, has some classic pop-punk lyrics that will revisit blink-182s discography afterward; the song speaks to the difficulties of resisting starting a new relationship even one knows it would be a catastrophic decision: "That’s why I don’t want what I want/’Cause what I want, it just might kill me.” These catchy and relatable lyrics make New Found Glory’s upcoming show in Bristol even more enthralling. Any concert-goer will know the words and enjoy other stand-outs such as Happy Being Miserable. With a title that explains it all, Happy Being Miserable takes a look at a relationship where one partner refuses to be happy.

If anyone is on the fence about buying themselves a ticket, factor New Found Glory’s 20 years of experience making and performing music guarantees that they know how to put on a good show. On top of that, New Found Glory has toured with other heavy-hitters such as blink-182 and collaborated with Hayley Williams. Their Bristol show should disappoint neither pop-punk die-hards nor those who are just looking for a fun show with a loveable band and nostalgic sound.
