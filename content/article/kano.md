On Wednesday 5th October Kano will be gracing The Lemon Grove’s stage with his presence and is bringing Little Simz with him. The London MC is touring his fifth studio album Made In The Manor which hit the top ten in the first week of it’s release. Exeter is the first of a countrywide run of 11 consecutive dates. Speaking about the album, Kano said: “You have to know where you’ve come from in order to know where you’re going. But I like to take where I’ve come from along with me for the ride.” Made In The Manor was nominated for the Mercury Prize and received almost exclusively positive reviews from the press. Kano has risen to fame over the last 15 years or so; regarded as being one of the forefathers of grime it’s a real treat that he is coming to Exeter. Having some of the most prominent songs on the genre, Ps and Qs for example, and working with the likes of Wiley and Giggs, it’s fair to say he is a big player in the game. His work features meaningful lyrics and smooth flows which goes some way in explaining his popularity. Outside of music he is a successful actor featuring as one of the main characters (Sully) in Drake’s favorite British TV series, Top Boy, alongside Asher D of So Solid Crew. The gig on Wednesday is pretty much sold out – there are a few tickets floating about but you really will need to move fast to guarantee entry.
