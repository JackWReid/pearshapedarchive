The young Isaac Gracie’s music career began at the tender age of seven as a member of the Ealing Abbey Choir until the inevitable drag of puberty brought an inability to hit those high notes and replaced it with a passion for the guitar. Gracie’s choral origins now provide his songs with hauntingly emotive vocals and his song-writing skill reveals a refined poeticism. His eponymous first album was released this year, with his melancholic tracks denoted by their aesthetic lower-case labelling. Since its release, Gracie has been presenting the album to eager audiences in various UK and European festivals, and now November sees his headline tour take him round select UK locations, including Exeter and Falmouth for often-neglected South-West audiences. His set list is likely to feature tracks from his new EP ‘close up- looking down’, released on the 16th November. The EP’s single ‘show me love’ has already proved its worth, having featured on Spotify’s new music playlist and Annie Mac’s radio show.

Gracie’s support will complement his sound perfectly, as the young Billie Marten has received huge critical acclaim for her intricately crafted, equally melancholic tunes, including her nomination for BBC Sound of 2016.
