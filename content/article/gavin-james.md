Buoyed by the worldwide release of his debut album Bitter Pill earlier this year, Gavin James embarks upon an 11-legged UK tour this October. The Irishman’s craft as a songwriter was spotted by fellow red-head and heartstring-tugger Ed Sheeran last year, as he supported Sheeran on a stadium tour. James admits to being mistaken for the headline act on occasion by screaming teens, "They thought I was him - while he was on stage behind them.” Such is the nature of performing at the 82,000 capacity Croke Park in Dublin!

James returns to the more modestly sized (and more aquatic! – yes, it is a boat) Thekla in Bristol on the 3rd of October. He recognises the key to building a fan base is to “gig, gig, gig” and no doubt will be keen to establish the sort of popularity in England that made Bitter Pill reach 5th in the Irish Album Charts. The Dubliner has even started to make some noise across the Atlantic, performing his album’s title track on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in March. Though James should be proud of his stadium performances, his tear-jerking ballads are more suitable to the intimacy of a small venue. With a second album in the pipeline, it would be foolish to squander the chance to see a star in the making. Otherwise you’ll find yourself paying 70 quid to see him at the O2 Arena sitting right at the back, and he’ll definitely look like Ed Sheeran from that far away.
