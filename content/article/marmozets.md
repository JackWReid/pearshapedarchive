It’s full steam ahead for chaotic math-rockers Marmozets. Fresh off the Reading and Leeds main stage, after a small U.K. summer tour of their own, which completely sold out, and having finished a support act slot for Muse, they’re not allowing themselves a break just yet. After announcing that work for their second album is complete, the band will now go back on tour for an extended run in October.

The summer tour saw the band debuting Play, a high-octane anthem that gives us a glimpse into the second album and suggests that we should expect more new material in October’s shows.

Bristol has already sold out, so you’ll have to travel even further from Exeter if you still want to catch them – it will be worth catching what might be their last bunch of shows in small venues. Marmozets’ debut album, The Weird And Wonderful Marmozets, catapulted the band into the spotlight like never before, so we can only imagine what heights they could reach with their second record.
