These guys put the ‘ska’ into skanking. Having sold out their last two visits to Exeter’s Phoenix, Gentleman’s Dub Club are set to do the same again. The noisy nine-piece know how to throw a good show; the crowds of Boomtown, Outlook and many other major festivals have all been uplifted by their potent dub. The band have also blessed our own Hijacked and Lemonfest for two unforgettable sets. Suited up with a tie and trumpet, GDC can be expected to bring nothing but vibrant energy.

Gentleman’s Dub Club have already built up a strong catalogue of music. It didn’t take long for songs like High Grade and Music is the Girl I Love to become classics. With their new single Stardust just dropping, this gig is sure to feature some unreleased material. They’re also sitting on a new album, Lost in Space, which will be out in January. The project follows their latest release, a star-studded collaboration album with veteran duo The Nextmen. The band are now staples of the UK dub scene, even being chosen by UB40 to support them on their upcoming 40th Anniversary Tour.

Back for the third year in a row, if you’ve missed their last shows its time you packed your reggae bags and climbed aboard. Expect black braces and smiling faces. Join the club.
