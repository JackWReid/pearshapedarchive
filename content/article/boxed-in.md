In a sea of aspiring electro-pop artists, Boxed In is steadily establishing himself as a critically acclaimed producer and singer, through his unique ability to fuse psychedelic rock with classic English electronic pop. Boxed In's music is as smooth as alternative electro-pop can get (with a few jarring irregularities thrown in, which creates variety) and does an excellent job at conveying specific moods through sultry and heavy beats and minimal (but impactful) lyrics.

Though Oli Bayston is the man behind most of Boxed In's music, he is often joined by a live band consisting of Jack Benfield, Mark Nicholis and Liam Hutton. All Your Love is Gone was Bayston's first single, which was released in November 2013, a month after he was featured in The Telegraph as New Band of The Week. The London-based artist's debut album Boxed In (released nearly 2 years after his first single) received accolades from music critics in the United Kingdom, and the album's lead singles were supported by BBC Radio 1. Bayston's dynamic debut was followed by another brilliant album in 2016, titled Melt, whose lead single Jist was premiered on BBC Radio 6. Forget, from Melt, was remixed by George Fitzgerald in October 2016 and is now Boxed In's most popular song on Apple Music.

Boxed In begins his UK tour in February and will be performing at Move, Exeter (supported by TBA) on the 11th. So, if you're a fan of the likes of Jamie xx, Lianna la Havas and LCD Soundsystem (Boxed In's self-proclaimed influences), I highly recommend that you don't miss out on Oli Bayston + Co.â€™s live performance.
