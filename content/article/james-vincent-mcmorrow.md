Irish artist James Vincent McMorrow has been making ripples in the music scene for a while now. His unique voice is soft and completely disarming, with a killer falsetto that makes you feel every word he says. His latest album We Move - which reached the number one position in Ireland – officially marked the point at which McMorrow started making waves. The album is the most personal he’s ever made, accompanied by an open letter to fans and an onslaught of personal information via his website. It seems that McMorrow has become the artist that he was always capable of being, and in many ways We Move shows an artist finally comfortable with himself.

For all these reasons, this is the best possible time to see James Vincent McMorrow live. With a voice so powerful, his live shows are always an almost ethereal experience; I saw him a few years ago at The Barbican when the staging was like the surface of the moon. The lights were amazing, obviously thought out to the last detail, and his voice was the best I’d ever heard live. McMorrow plays Colston Hall in Bristol on 12th October. Go if you know what’s good for you.
