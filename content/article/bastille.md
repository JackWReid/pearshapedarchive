On Saturday 29th October, Bastille are coming to Plymouth Pavilions. The band began as the solo project of lead singer Dan Smith (whose birthday falls on Bastille Day, hence the name) before being expanded into a 4 piece band in 2010. Considering they are a band with only one full length studio album behind them, they have amassed a huge fan base and following. This is undoubtedly thanks to hit songs such as Pompeii and Flaws as well as their album, Bad Blood - or the even better deluxe, All This Bad Blood – which in my opinion, doesn’t include one bad song. It was such a top quality debut album that it was nominated for a Brit, with the band also winning Best Breakthrough Act as a result. However, that album was released in 2013, and so it will excite fans to know that after almost three years the tour which the Plymouth show is a part of accompanies a new album, Wild World. Due in early September, the lead single Good Grief has already been released – and it’s sounding like a good start.

Even without the new album, the prospect of Bastille live is always as treat. Having seen them once before at last year’s Leeds Festival, it is clear they are crowd-pleasers. Lead singer Smith’s rather self-deprecating interaction with his audience is enjoyable and often quite funny, and the band seem to have a knack for livening up a crowd at just the right times. Bastille are a top quality band to see live, and with a new album to show, this could surely be one of the concert highlights of the 2016-2017 year in the South-West. It’s definitely not one to be missed.
