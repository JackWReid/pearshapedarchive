_**I was super impressed with you guys in the semi-final- are you getting excited for the final?**_ **AS:** Yeah, really excited. **GH:** Definitely, it always draws a crowd.

_**Any hints about what we can expect?**_ **GH:** There won’t be any new stuff but we’ve really worked on the transitions between songs and the introductions for them, making the set more fluid. **AS:** Yeah, we’ve just been doing lots of practicing.

_**Have you got a favourite song to play live?**_ **AS:** Ooh I don’t know, I like Tell Me but also Twin Peaks, they’re both really fun to play.

_**Who are your favourite new artists out right now?**_ **GH:** I was listening to the new DIIV album a lot, and the Neon Indian album which came out late last year. I only downloaded that about two weeks ago but I really like it, it’s really cool. **AS:** I’m really impressed with Tame Impala’s Currents as well, that’s a really good album. That was out last year as well though!

_**Who would you say has influenced your sound?**_ **GH:** We listen to everything really. We work on a song by song basis, just if we think a song is cool, but it could end up pretty different to the others. **AS:** I think there is just good music everywhere really, in every genre. It’s about the people who are playing it and the techniques they use.

_**What has been your favourite moment since you started the band?**_ **AS:** Last year’s Battle of the Bands was pretty exciting because we hadn’t been together for long, I think it was only two weeks, and we managed to write a song between each heat and actually get through to the final. It was also good when we got played on the radio the other day as well! **GH:** It’s been nice just seeing the songs get better as well, I think we’re generally a lot happier with them now.

_**Can you see a progression through your work?**_ **GH:** Yeah, we’re just definitely better at writing them now! **AS:** And when we just do random jams, they’re getting a lot better now too.

_**How often do you guys rehearse then?**_ **GH:** In the lead up to something, I’d say about twice a week. But if not, it’ll tend to be that we practice less and then have more writing sessions.

_**Where would be your dream place to play live?**_ **GH:** A festival would be nice. **AS:** Yeah a festival would be cool, it would be nice to meet loads of other artists while you’re there.

_**What have you guys got planned next, for after Battle of the Bands?**_ **GH:** We were invited by Rory from the band Bloom to do our own live session where we’ll be recorded and filmed- I think BBC Introducing are involved somehow so that should be cool.
