When it comes to exercise, music makes all the difference. This isn’t just my opinion, it’s scientific fact. Run listening to pumping, driving, triumphant music and the adrenaline rushes around your body, the endorphins make you feel like you could keep going forever, dopamine is released into your brain having an almost drug like effect. There’s nothing quite like the adrenaline buzz which only the combination of physical exercise and pumping tunes can provide. Usain Bolt can run 100 metres in 9.58 seconds — just imagine what he’d be like if he sprung off the starting blocks with Death Grips, Technotronic, or Rage Against The Machine ringing in his ears. If, on the other hand, you run with nothing to focus on but the sound of your own panting and wheezing, it’s not energy-enhancing chemicals being released into the brain, but nagging thoughts about how weak you are, and how fun this really isn’t, how you’d much rather be curled up on the sofa doing nothing at all (don’t worry there’s a playlist coming for that too — we don’t discriminate here.)

Whether you need driving rhythms to set the pace of your run, motivational lyrics to get you through that final deadlift, or feel good party songs to soundtrack your next PB, the PearShaped Workout Playlist has it all. Compiled by 16 different PearShaped writers, the playlist not only caters to all workout preferences, but also to all musical tastes. And all without an Eye Of The Tiger in sight.
