In the midst of an extensive tour flittering all over both Europe and the US, Local Natives will be returning to Bristol at Motion nightclub on November 4 – bringing their special brand of indie rock with them. It’s their third album, Sunlit Youth, that the Californian 5-piece are promoting; having first risen to prominence way-back-when in 2009, they immediately made a name for themselves for their emotive 3-part harmonies and their energetic and stirring sonic backdrop. They have a strong following from the indie circuit; if you’re into anything from Vampire Weekend, Grizzly Bear, Fleet Foxes, The National, or Yeasayer, you should be into this.

And God, do they know how to put on a show. The energy of Local Natives’ songs is amped onto another level in their live gigs; they were the first proper gig I ever went to and I didn’t stop smiling for a good 3 days afterwards – the vivacity of their spirit is infectious. It’s not a show you’d want to miss.
