This coming April, big name electropop star MØ will perform at the O2 Academy in Bristol. Born as Karen Marie Aagaard Ørsted Andersen, the Danish singer and songwriter goes by the alias MØ, combining the letters of her middle names to create the Danish word for ‘maiden’ or ‘virgin’. She started her music career with a variety of small projects, including a project called The Edmunds and a duo called MOR. Ørsted rebranded as MØ in 2012, releasing her debut single Glass in early 2013. She continued releasing singles intermittently until the release of her first album No Mythologies to Follow in spring 2014. In late 2015, she released a new single Kamikaze, followed by Final Song in mid 2016.

MØ has collaborated with a variety of popular artists including Iggy Azalea, Elliphant, Major Lazer, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Snakehips, and DJ Snake. The collaborations often top musical charts, gaining popularity for catchy beats and MØ’s sultry vocals. In her solo music, MØ contrasts synth beats with her sincere lyrics. The addition of simple guitar melodies makes her songs simple but powerful, most of which are more toned down than her pop-py collaborative hits. A live show would allow for MØ to showcase her more vulnerable solo charts in an intimate setting.

As MØ announced yesterday, she has postponed her upcoming European tour to spend more time developing her new music and her performance. Most dates in England and Ireland have been pushed back to late March and early April to allow for this show development, with her Bristol performance at O2 Academy moved to Saturday April 7th, 2018. The opening act has yet to be announced but all original tickets from prior to the postponement still stand. Whether or not you are familiar with her music, MØ is sure to put on an incredible show in Bristol this coming spring that is not to be missed!
