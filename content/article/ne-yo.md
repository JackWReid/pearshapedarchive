An iconic part of the R&B scene since he first broke into it ten years ago with the smooth classics Sexy Love and So Sick, Ne-Yo is back to prove to us all why he has had such an enduring career, playing at Bristol’s Colston Hall on 13th December.

Following the release of his album Non-Fiction last year, Ne-Yo is performing only eleven dates across the UK as part of his 2016 tour. Despite extensive touring over the last decade, this is the first time that the American R&B icon will be bringing his back catalogue of soulful songs to Bristol.

Known as the “heir to the Rat Pack legacy” and self-professed as “Ne-Yo the Gentleman”, Ne-Yo presents himself as the smooth-singing, best dressed man of R&B. However, his musical contributions are much more than that. He’s not only the second male R&B artist to have six consecutive top ten albums in the US (behind someone who is arguably his opposite in terms of class; Chris Brown), but he is also the mastermind behind many noughties classics such as Let Me Love You, Irreplaceable and Take a Bow, proving just why his career has such longevity.

For R&B fans, this is a night not to be missed, if only to hear the man himself perform Miss Independent.
