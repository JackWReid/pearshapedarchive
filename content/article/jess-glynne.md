What’s more to say about a live Jess Glynne performance other than the promise of some absolute bangers and an amazing experience. The London born singer broke onto the scene spectacularly back in early 2014 with My Love, and it’s been all uphill since then. Her commanding vocal presence been featured in multiple chart topping singles and I Cry When I Laugh, released back in August 2015, was the second fastest selling debut album of that year, solidifying her as a strong solo act too. She ended the year of 2015 with 5 number one singles in the UK, a feat shared only by 1 other UK artist. We all know her from Clean Bandit’s Rather Be and Real Love, or as the soundtrack to multiple nights out at Arena (or Unit 1 if you’re that kind of person), and now she’ll be making her way down to Plymouth on the 28th of November. Make sure you catch her show at the Pavilions for an electrifying and memorable night.
