Creature Songs is the latest musical offering from Wolf Alice, a four-piece from London who are well worth getting excited about. Despite being around since 2011, Creature Songs is only the second EP to come from Wolf Alice. Instead the band have been experimenting with their music live, creating a sound best described as "the lovechild of folk and grudge", whilst collecting fans along the way.

The first single from the EP, Moaning Lisa Smile, is a prime example of how good Wolf Alice sound live. The simple guitar intro before the storm of a chorus is reminiscent of the band’s 2013 track, Fluffy, as the tone builds up before suddenly dropping away. After listening to the song on repeat - it's short and sweet at just two minutes and forty seconds - you hear how methodically each section of the song has been put together. From its infectious melody to Ellie Rowsell’s vocals, Moaning Lisa Smile sounds like it has been played to perfection.

Storms has a far more assertive intro, yet also follows the Wolf Alice formula of showcasing a different instrument in each section of the track. But what Wolf Alice really master is managing to give each instrument its own part whilst still sounding good as a collective. The band does not try to put too much into one song, allowing their music to have a structure that somehow sounds effortless. There is no real chorus to Storms but I like that, as it means Ellie’s repeated, "Who are your friends, your friends?" sounds like a chant above all else.

Heavenly Creatures has a far dreamier, distorted feel, carried by a sweet guitar melody. The song offers a calmer comedown from the first two tracks, demonstrating why Wolf Alice cannot be pigeon-holed into grunge or rock. As an EP, Creature Songs establishes Wolf Alice as a band making the music they want to, which is what all EPs and albums should do.

We’re Not The Same also sounds distinct from the songs it follows. The sweet harmonies between front woman Ellie and drummer Joel Amey are contrasted by their sardonic lyrics: "We’re not the same, oh what a shame". It’s Wolf Alice’s tone of pure sass that makes them so appealing.

Whilst Wolf Alice are known to be working on an album it is not expected until 2015. Yet in the meantime the band is on tour, finishing at the London Scala on 28th May. They'll also be playing the festival circuit this summer, including Glastonbury and Bestival. Creature Songs is worth getting excited about, and you should try and see Wolf Alice live if you get the chance.
