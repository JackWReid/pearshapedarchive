British Sea Power (BSP) are a Brighton based alternative indie band, renowned for their live performances, decidedly idiosyncratic lyrical content and (according to Wikipedia) ‘adventurous choice of locations for … their shows’. Although I wouldn’t necessarily describe the Phoenix as an _adventurous_ venue, BSP will be rocking Exeter on the 10th of February for a gig that promises to impress.

By means of a testament to this, my parents saw BSP play at the British Summer Time festival in Hyde Park last summer and thoroughly enjoyed their performance – which included dancing bear mascots (presumably left over from the tour which accompanied their previous album _Machineries of Joy_). But don’t be fooled by the fact that my parents appreciate their music: British Sea Power was one of the first bands that got me into the English alternative music scene, and each of their releases is outstandingly varied: from the more traditional sounding indie pop of _Open Season_, to the 28-piece brass band supporting the aptly named _Sea of Brass_ (a concept that was [‘first thought up while drinking whisky on an easyJet flight back from Scotland’](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-sea-power-why-is-an-indie-band-using-28-piece-brass-bands-on-their-new-album-a6680541.html)).

Their latest offering, Let The Dancers Inherit The Party, was released in 2017 to critical acclaim, and includes some of their most advanced material to date. For a band that’s been playing together for over 17 years, Let The Dancers Inherit The Party is a testament to the veteran band’s talent – drawing from the experimental and pop/rock elements of their previous work to create a truly unique musical experience.
