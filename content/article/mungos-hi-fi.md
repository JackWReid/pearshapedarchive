On Saturday 3rd December Beatz and Bobz are bringing one of Britain’s oldest and most respected sound systems to the Exeter Phoenix. Mungo’s Hi-Fi are a pair of Glasgow based DJs/producers who have put out some of the most popular home-grown reggae and dancehall records ever. They have worked with a huge range of artists, from Sugar Minott all the way through to the new kids on the block Major Lazer. Having relapsed five records of their own and helped with the creation of countless others, they are true legends - this will be a gig to remember.

Joining them on stage is Solo Banton who, having collaborated with Mungo on numerous records, is the perfect man to be stepping up before them. Not only has DJ Banton recently started recording, his tunes often feature comical lyrics, with having a good time being put to the forefront of everything he does. The man loves what he does and is constantly on the road; whether it be shelling down sound systems in Jamaica or performing at Exeter Phoenix, crowds love him.

On what will almost certainly be a wet/cold/windy (delete as appropriate) evening the Phoenix will be full of sunshine as the selectors entertain us in what I’m sure will be a cracker of a night.
