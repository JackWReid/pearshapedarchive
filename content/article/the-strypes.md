Though Irish indie outfit The Strypes are certainly young, one would be hard pushed to call them inexperienced. They have already toured Australia, made appearances on high profile American TV shows, and supported Arctic Monkeys all over Europe. Now, following the release of their third album Spitting Image in June, these sub-21 year olds are bringing their youthful hi-jinks and shiny new-wave inspired sound to Thekla in Bristol. Hardcore fans need not worry, some of the scuzzy garage rock that they made their name playing is sure to feature in their set too.

Keep your eyes peeled for new album opener Behind Closed Doors and its pleasing vintage soundscape. Or, if you are a fan of more gritty tunes, look out for the unmistakably solid, swaggering song get into it, which is for all intents and purposes a total banger.

With nods from the likes of rock and roll heavyweights such as Dave Grohl, it doesn’t take a genius to work out that The Strypes’ star power is in its ascendancy. Be sure to catch them at Thekla before larger stages beckon.
