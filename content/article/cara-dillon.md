Timed to the release of her upcoming Christmas album Upon a Winter’s Night, Cara Dillon’s UK tour is sweeping the nation with the whimsical, stunning singing we have all come to expect from the Irish singer-songwriter. The Irish-folk singer began performing aged 14 and hasn’t given up her musical roots since winning the All Ireland Singing Trophy at the same age. In 2001 Dillon released her debut self-titled album under Rough Trade records. That same year BBC Radio 2 gave her two Folk Awards; she was nominated again for one last year. As we can see, nothing has stopped her from continuing to produce exquisitely emotional music.

Compared to other folk artists, her songs have a heightened sensitivity about them that is mostly due to her haunting voice. Indeed, her angelic vocals has earned her a cult following on the folk scene and since 2010 can officially be termed ‘Disney-sweet’ after leading the opening song for Disney's Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue. This Derry born songstress hasn’t let success hamper her approachable style: during her last tour she apparently chatted away to the audience as if catching up with old friends.

At this performance Dillon is bound to hold your ears rapt. Featuring a symphony of instruments like bass, banjo, accordion, fiddle and violin, you can be sure that this live performance will be a festive hit. Cara Dillon has the perfect, gentle voice to transport you away from deadlines into a soothing winter scene of calm. Give Timepiece a miss this time and opt for indulgent escapism without going far at all: Phoenix, where Dillon will be performing, is located in central Exeter.
