Exams are over, the [PearShaped Revision Playlist](http://pearshapedexeter.com/100-songs-of-revision/) has run its course, and summer is upon us. Whether that means lying on a beach, beers and a BBQ, camping, or simply the enjoyment of having nothing to do, we’ve got you covered with our 100 track summer playlist. With everything from Kanye West to King Gizzard, Mac Demarco to Marvin Gaye, and with every genre from reggae to R&B, there’s a song here for every summery occasion. Also keep an ear out for Exeter locals Alice Jemima, Emmi, and Sam England.
