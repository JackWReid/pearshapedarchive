_**Your new album, All These Countless Nights, came out at the end of January. Can you tell us about how you decided to give the album this title, and a little about the theme of the album in general?**_ Well the title All These Countless Nights comes from a line in the song Happiness and as soon as we started thinking about using that for the title it just seemed to fit perfectly. The album itself is a collection of stories and events that have happened to us over the last few years over various different nights, so it just seemed to sit really well for us as a thematic title.[](http://www.philsmithies.photo/)

_**What’s the response been so far on the release?**_ To be honest it's been a little bit overwhelming. It's been so positive and for us to come back after so long out without really doing anything, to be reminded that so many people care and care so much about us, is just incredible. It's an amazing feeling.

_**Is there a track that is your favourite?**_ My own favourite always changes depending on what mood I'm in, but I'd have to say that my favourite track at the moment is Pretty Low. It's got a really awkward triplet rhythm which we haven't really played around with before which I like, but more than anything it's probably the most melancholic track on the record and I'm a real sucker for a sad song.

_**The album is pretty diverse in sound – do you find this is an important feature when putting out an LP?**_ I think all the albums that I really love have ebbs and flows and peaks and lows throughout, that's the thing that really makes me as a listener feel like I've been taken on a journey and it's something that I'm extremely proud of in All These Countless Nights. 

_**You've previously had a few guest vocalists on tracks - if you could collaborate with someone alive or dead – who would it be and why?**_ For me personally it'd have to be Trent Reznor. I mean the guy is a musical genius (and my favourite artist of all time) but the way he thinks about music and composes anything seems very far away from how we come up with anything and I think that would be fascinating to see. 

_**Is there a venue that you are most excited to play the new material/ on tour?**_ It'd have to be the Forum in Kentish Town. London shows are normally the biggest shows of the tour for us, so it's always the real barometer of how well anything is being received by seeing how the crowd respond there.  

_**Do you enjoy being on tour? What's the best aspect for you?**_ More than anything else I love the camaraderie you get as a group. I know not all bands really get along that well, but we do and it's amazing. That feeling of playing music with your best friends and then feeling that high after a show and getting drunk together and then getting up the next day to do it all again - it's something else, I can tell you.  

_**Looking further forward – festival season is looming on the horizon – have you got any plans so far?**_ We do have a few plans lurking around. Nothing that we can explicitly divulge as yet, but all I will say is keep your ears listening and your eyes peeled! 

_**What does the rest of 2017 hold for you?**_ Just more and more shows really. Getting out to as many different countries as we can and playing to as many people as we can. We're incredibly happy to be back!
