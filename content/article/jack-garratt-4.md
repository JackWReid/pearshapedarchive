Jack Garratt is simply one of a kind. Following an attempt at Junior Eurovision ten years ago, a crack at becoming a teacher and a failed blues album; Garratt found his forte in 2013 as a multi-instrumentalist. His sound has taken music to a new direction and has been described by some as a combination of “classic melodies with warps and beats of cutting edge music”. He has stated that his sound has been affected by a wide range of influences, from Stevie Wonder to Jack White.

Phase, his debut album, was released in February of this year and was a huge hit with fans of an array of genres. Following the release of his debut album, he has gone from strength to strength winning both the Brits Critics’ Choice Award and the BBC Sound of 2016. He follows in the same footsteps as Ellie Goulding and Sam Smith who have also won both accolades - it is clear that the sky is the limit for Jack Garratt.

Be quick though, there are only a handful of tickets left for his performance at The Pavillions. Catch him before he becomes a world super-star!
