My laptop broke this week and it follows (naturally) that my life has been hell as result. But was that going to stop the Listening Post being written? The answer: apparently not! Hence cast your eyes upon the following five tracks that I, on behalf of the PearShaped family, urge you to have a peek at. Enjoy!

**1\.  Mind Enterprises – Chapita**

A group of twenty-somethings draped in normcore and topped with hipster hairdos carouse around with electro-indie artist, Mind Enterprise, in the video to this, his latest release. It’s a combination of pronounced keyboards, star-spangled synths and splatters of bass, super interesting to listen to without becoming too much on the ears. I really like that sound of organised chaos and this young man has already perfected it – just a few songs into his career too!

**2\.  MOTHXR – Touch**

Funky outfit Mother have re-graced the scene with their irresistible fusion of discotheque guitars and downbeat vocals and production. What makes this piece so engaging is its almost psych-like progressive style; working through a funky opening it drifts into something more chaotic and electro before leaping back up into a guitar-lead nostalgia track – it finally closes with a beautiful percussion-packed sequence.

**3\.  IAMBENJI – Found Me Now**

Known offline as Benji Boko, our third artist this week falls into what I’d call the genre of “Post-Jai-Paul-Electro” – that is to say that this short song is of a similar ilk to some successful contemporary electro starlets such as Ben Khan or Nao. Found Me Now has its own very unique and seductive sound however, employing a retro vocalist with chanting samples that, against the odds, compliment the pangs of electronica magnificently.

**4\.  London O’Connor – Natural**

Yeah, he’s got a weird name… but when someone mixes genres to such a great effect without compromising on quality, they can call themselves whatever they want. A chilled production that strays from traditional hip-hop by incorporating R&B and pop elements sits behind London’s gorgeous singing voice. But, determined not to impress with just those two pleasing aspects of Natural, the American slips into a few verses of rap too – I’ll be keeping my eyes on this guy, he’s real smooth…

**5\.  biLLLy – Confused Lover**

A delicate beat is masked by several pitches and layers of funk guitar. Londoner biLLLY entices you with casual but superbly professional vocals; his lyrics are cool and interesting. The song is about identifying problems within a relationship – heavy stuff. So if you’re not into some mopey guy infecting your thoughts – just blur out the meaning and enjoy this for what it is: a plain beauty.
