> Pure house grooves, jacking beats and a feel-good atmosphere.

That’s how Moe Jatthews who originates from Shropshire in the West Midlands, portrays himself as a DJ.

Aged 19, and having grown up on his brother’s musical combination of 80s enfused electronic drum and bass, alongside his own passion for house music, Moe has ended up with a wide spectrum of musical influences. Today, Moe occupies himself in his community by playing at a local nightclub. Although mixing is an immense passion of his, producing is an ever developing interest.

_**How did you first get involved in music and mixing?**_ I started to play the drums for a couple of years when I was younger, but when my brother introduced me to Ableton 2 years ago I started using a MIDI keyboard and it went from there.

**Were there any particular tracks that inspired you when you first got into DJing?** Inspired me? Definitely the track Tarantula by Pleasurekraft. I remember ‘attempting’ to mix that tune with Happy Up Here (Boys Noize Remix), for the first time. Wasn’t the best to say the least but we all have to start somewhere.

_**How did you end up playing your first DJ set?**_ In my local area, I spoke to the landlord of a bar who needed someone to DJ for a student night. I gladly accepted although I was very nervous - as anyone would be on their first time playing out. On the whole I felt it went quite well, and it must have been as I was offered a regular slot there.

_**Any acts you think we should be paying particular attention to?**_ You should definitely keep an eye out for Polkadot, a House/ garage producer who features on Madtech Records – I’ve really been enjoying his tracks lately. I’ve also been listening to Gorgon City as well. Releasing their Real EP earlier this year, Gorgon City’s blend of house and bass creates deep and jacking tracks.

_**Gorgon City are sick, love the Real EP. What’s the best gig/festival you’ve been to recently?**_ The best gig I’ve been to has to have been Justice at the O2 Academy in Birmingham in February 2012. The were incredible. I missed out on the Gottwood festival this year, set in a picturesque forest in Angelsey, Wales. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys house music and wants to get away from a busy life in the city for a weekend.

_**Finally, any good bands that you’ve been listening to outside of the house and dance genres that we should know about?**_ I haven’t really been listening to bands lately in all honesty. However, Enter Shikari have always been an inspirational band to me. Their high-energy stage presence has always been a highlight for me and I’ve always enjoyed their music.
