On the 26th of November Laura Mvula will be playing as part of her current tour at Bristol’s O2 Academy. Her latest album, The Dreaming Room, released in June this year, was nominated for the Mercury Prize but sadly missed out to an equally great new album, Konnichiwa by Skepta. Whilst grime has been more typically the fashion this year there’s definitely still bags of room for talent like Laura Mvula.

Since coming onto the bigger music scene in 2013 with her debut album Sing to the Stars, Mvula gained fast popularity and won MOBO Awards for best Female Act (beating Jessie J and Rita Ora) and Best R&B/Soul Act, as well as Best Female Act in the Urban Music Awards the same year.

With a degree in classical composition and citing Nina Simone, Pierre Boulez, and Miles Davis as inspiration you realise instantly that you are in more than capable musical hands when you first listen to Mvula. Orchestral soul-pop is probably the best way to describe Mvula’s sound, although the effect is not quite like anything else available in the current music scene.

It’s new, it’s experimental and it’s beautiful. Check out Laura Mvula in Bristol this November if you can.
