Two years after their debut album release, Amber Run are back with brand new music coinciding with a UK tour in February. The bands sophomore album, For A Moment, I Was Lost, will be released in the midst of this tour, three days before they perform in Exeter on the 13th February.

The five-piece indie-rock band formed five years ago after dropping out of the University of Nottingham to focus on creating more music, and were soon seen playing the BBC Introducing Stage at Reading Festival and supporting Kodaline on their 2014 tour. Their first album, 5am, dipped into the UK’s top 40, and the band rode this success across Europe and the UK taking the album on tour. With a new album waiting in the wings ready for release, we can expect to hear more of this quintet as the hype has been building ever since the release of lead single, Haze.

Judging by the three additional records released since Haze, this album promises more of the sound we have come to know and love. Through vocal harmonies mixed with delicate piano lines and guitar solos, they build their songs up to a crescendo, with lead singer Joe Keogh belting out choruses made for arenas. I personally cannot wait to see them perform at our very own Phoenix, and this really is a gig you shouldn’t miss. Expect intimate, captivating moments for sure, but don’t be surprised when the crowd erupts around you.
