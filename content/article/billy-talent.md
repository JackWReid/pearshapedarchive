Just a few months ago Billy Talent released their fifth album to date, full of political narrative and unique riffs. This October, the band are returning to the UK for the first time in four years to put on a night of brilliant rock music at Bristol’s O2 Academy.

No strangers to huge crowds and wild atmospheres, this summer Billy Talent took on Summer Sonic Festival, Amnesia Rockfest, Download Festival as well as the classic Rock Am Ring. Now heading out on the Afraid Of Heights tour across Europe, the band are sure to put on a show.

Last time Billy Talent came to the UK, I had the fantastic opportunity of being the show correspondent for Birmingham – meaning I got to meet the band before the show and head backstage. That night I not only learned that these four guys are some of rock’s greatest talents, but also genuinely friendly and kind people. It can be an empty feeling to buy the albums and merch of many millionaire musicians these days, but Billy Talent are a band that I am more than happy to support. They don’t believe in all of the capitalist greed crap and they despise Donald Trump… What’s more to like about them?

Billy Talent have a habit of only coming the UK twice every decade so make sure you catch them in Bristol while you have the chance.
