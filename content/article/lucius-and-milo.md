_**Where does Lucius and Milo come from?**_ **Davide Scarpignato:** Can we be honest for once? **Theo Stone**: Me and Dom don’t know. **Charlie Pelham-Lane:** We made a list of band names that we would put forward, and I thought it would be a good shout because it comes from a Roman story about a guy who gets turned into a Donkey. Milo is the husband of a witch. Lucius stays at his house and spies on the witch making concoctions, and she sees him and as a punishment turns him into a donkey. Then the rest of the book is about his adventures as a Donkey. The title is commonly translated into English as the Golden Ass.

**_What are your influences - who would you say informs your original songs the most?_** **CPL:** My songs don’t get influenced by anything to be honest, I get a tune in my head at 2am in the morning and then sit down at the piano later and write it out. But if I were to say a band I like, I’d go for Coldplay. **DS:** I’m really into U2 and REM and a bit of post-punk revival such as Interpol, I’m into that pop/rock genre. But most of my songs were composed when I was in another band so my taste is changing, and so is what I write.

_**How have you found the heats and the bands you’ve performed against?**_ **Dom Ford**: I think we’ve all had quite different experiences, this is my third battle of the bands but the first time I’ve been to the final, so I know how it all goes but its still really exciting. **TS:** The competition has been really fierce, Joker’s Gamble and Allergens are exceptional. **DF:** The first heat was Charlie’s first gig. **CPL:** Yeah, the first time I played on stage was the first heat. **DS:** But I think we’re comfortable on stage, we have a really good relationship with the audience. **CPL:** Yeah, the audience has been fantastic, I’m really grateful to Campus Bands, it’s great time to perform together for the first time in such a great atmosphere. **TS:** It’s been great. Having played last year, this year the audience has been much bigger and the atmosphere has been far more welcoming.

_**What can we expect in the Final?**_ **DF:** We like to have a surprise cover - last time it was Watercolour by Pendulum. Because it is such a quick turnaround between the semi and the final we won’t change the set too much, but the cover will be different.

_**What are your plans for after the Final?**_ **CPL:** Recording is the next step, but we don’t want to give up on the gigs so we’ll take what we can get over the next few months.

_**What are you listening to at the moment?**_ **DF:** While I’ve been studying I’ve been listening to Heilung, which is the old Germanic word for healing. They only use recreated sounds to create very viking sounding songs - it really gets me in the zone for working. **TS:** I love a Russian duo called IamtheMorning, who are chamber progressive. I highly recommend their album. **DS:** I’m really looking forward to the new LCD Soundsystem Album. **CPL:** Definitely Snarky Puppy.
