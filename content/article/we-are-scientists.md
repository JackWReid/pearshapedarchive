Formed in 2000, We Are Scientists acquired their name upon returning a U-Haul trailer in San Francisco – whilst the employee checked over the vehicle he initially asked if the three “non-athletic bespectacled dudes” were brothers, further elaborating to question if they “were all scientists?” The name stuck with the duo Keith Murray, vocalist, and Chris Cain, bassist, forming the core of the band; with drummers revolving intermittently.

Six years later, the band’s first studio album With Love And Squalor was met with modest popularity in America but proved to be their breakthrough in the UK, drawing comparisons to The Killers and Franz Ferdinand. The album gained golden status by selling 100,000 copies in the UK alone and resulted in the band regarding the UK as their “adopted home”.

Touring on the back of their fourth studio album, Helter Seltzer, they are covering nearly every corner of the UK from Aberdeen to Falmouth, reaching out to their much-loved UK fans. The set will include a mixture of songs from their strong discography and their self-proclaimed ‘witty banter’, which Cain says they spend “roughly 100 hours a week researching and developing.”

Set to play The Lemon Grove this Wednesday, with tickets for just £6 this is not one to be missed!
