Seasick Steve has become an out-of-time icon in twenty-first century music. Having found success late in life after a 2006 performance on Jools Holland, he has become known not only for his ageless, gritty blues music but also for the way it is produced – on handmade, hodge-podge and hardy instruments such as the cheap and well-worn three-string guitar known as The Trance Wonder and another made out of Morris Minor hubcaps.

Once an old school US hobo and drifter, Steve has now performed at Glastonbury, Reading and headlined Portsmouth’s Victorious Festival, as well as a sold-out tours visiting the Hammersmith Apollo and the Royal Albert Hall. Promoting his latest album, Can U Cook?, Steve’s gig at Exeter Great Hall will showcase his dazzling new work and older classics to an audience of old and new fans.
