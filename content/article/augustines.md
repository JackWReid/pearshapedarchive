Augustines will be returning to Bristol on 17th October for the first time since performing just before headliners Mystery Jets at Dot to Dot festival in June. However, much has changed for the band since then. At the beginning of September, the band posted a heartfelt letter on their website and social media stating that their upcoming tour would be their last, which is truly sad news for fans of honest and sincere music.

Hailing from New York, Augustines specialise in simple but emotive and hard hitting indie rock in a similar vein to Frightened Rabbit or Mumford and Sons. Since forming in 2010 from the ashes of vocalist/guitarist Billy McCarthy and bassist Eric Sanderson’s previous band, Pela, they have have released 3 records and built a substantial fan base on both sides of the Atlantic. The most recent of these albums is 2016’s This Is Your Life, which lead McCarthy has described as being about “feeling disconnected in a world that’s changing”. It mostly sticks to the classic Augustines sound with a few extra production tricks, because why fix what’s not broken?.

The band’s live show is full of passion and intimacy. Indie hits like Chapel Song and Cruel City are belted out by fans during sets that often feature double encores, unplugged tracks and McCarthy performing amongst the crowd. It’s almost impossible not to have a good time watching Augustines.

If a night of authentic, heart on your sleeve anthems is what you’re after, then Bristol’s SWX is the place to be on 17th October. The show is one of Augustines’ last in the UK, so it’s not to be missed.
