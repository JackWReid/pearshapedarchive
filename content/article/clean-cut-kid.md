For a band with such a strong beard game, known to lay down fuzzy guitar riffs and brash keyboard lines, the name “Clean Cut Kid” doesn’t immediately spring to mind. The band are making quite a name for themselves amongst the indie music scene, having recently signed with Polydor Records and subsequently gaining a lot of radio airplay.

The talented Liverpool based indie pop four-piece are currently on a UK tour, playing Bristol’s The Louisiana on the 24th October. Clean Cut Kid first caught my attention when watching them on the BBC Introducing stage at Reading. Faced by what seemed like a difficult crowd, the band was full of energy, with the bassist Saul Goodman jumping up and down as if on a pogo stick. I was seriously impressed with their modest, raw, yet occasionally flamboyant sound. A brilliant husband and wife team, lead singer Mike and Evelyn Halls’ chemistry is obvious, with bold two-part harmonies and interchange between rash guitar chords from Mike and colourful keyboard licks from Evelyn. It makes the band’s Gabriel/Bowie influenced sound really tick. With wonderfully produced singles such as We Used To Be In Love, Vitamin C and Runaway, make sure you clear your diary and head over to The Louisiana this October to catch one of the UKs most exciting new bands.
