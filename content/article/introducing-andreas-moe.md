Andreas Moe, a Swedish singer-songwriter, is providing us with a refreshing new take on alternative pop all the way from Stockholm. I first saw him in concert playing alongside Amber Run and supporting Lewis Watson at the Shepherds Bush Empire, and two years later that remains one of my favourite gigs.

Since 2012, Moe has released four EPs and in late 2015 he released his debut album in Sweden, entitled Before The Rumble Comes. Thirteen songs long it is a perfect blend of chilled out acoustic guitar with authentic vocals, upbeat choruses and cheerful folk sections. He showcases his impressive falsetto alongside synthesised electronic lines, trumpet flourishes and quirky piano melodies, creating an easy-listening, happy and summery vibe, more interesting than the conventional acoustic album (be sure to give the beguiling single Ocean a listen, it’ll be stuck in your head for days).

Moe is attempting to enter the music industry in what appears to be an already overcrowded scene; with the likes of Passenger, Ed Sheeran and Ben Howard already dominating this field, you might say there is no room for any more male singers who jam along to a few guitar chords and the occasional piano riff. However, to keep this genre alive and fresh we need new artists emerging and attempting new things, and as he mixes electronic synth music with acoustic ballads I believe he can break into the genre and be heard alongside other artists with a similar sound.

If my opinion isn’t enough to convince you to have a listen, he has collaborated with Tiesto, Lawson and fellow Swede, Avicii, and recently performed at Boardmasters festival in Cornwall. With a second album confirmed I believe he will soon be a household name, and with the first album available as a free download online there really is nothing stopping you.
