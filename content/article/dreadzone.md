Eclectic reggae-folk-dance-dub beasts Dreadzone will be bringing their trippy vibe to Exeter’s Phoenix on Saturday 4 March, and it’s probably going to be nuts. Scratch that, it’s going to be nuts. If you’ve never heard of them, I’d suggest getting your ears around Captain Dread, Lot’s Dub (extended version, seriously) and Rootsman to hear for yourself just what they’re about.

Dread Times came out a just a few days ago, making it the band’s seventh full studio release since their formation in 1993. They’ve played the Russian Roulette members game, and have had guest vocals from the likes of Alison Goldfrapp in the past. Whoever the line-up consists of at any given time, they’re always pushing boundaries, mixing genres, and creating soundscapes that make you want to chill and dance simultaneously.

Their Exeter date is just one of an extensive UK tour they’re embarking on this spring, from the conventional Manchester – London – Bristol circuit to some, frankly, unexplainable dates. Marlborough? Poole? Milton Keynes? Nowhere can escape the zone, so why fight it? They want to bring genre bending reggae madness to the masses, so grab a ticket and enjoy the show.
