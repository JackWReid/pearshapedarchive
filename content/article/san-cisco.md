After a string of dates across North America and Mexico, San Cisco kick of the English leg of their tour in Bristol this coming Thursday. The Australian four-piece have only two dates in England before jumping across to several continental cities. Since forming in 2009, San Cisco have always played around with indie-pop and rock sounds, citing mid-2000s indie juggernauts such as MGMT and Vampire Weekend as influencing their happy-go-lucky sound.

And whilst they’ve kept their indie-pop leanings going into their third studio release, The Water, the band are hopeful that this record and tour will showcase their maturity as performers and songwriters. It seems fitting, as they tour their third studio release that they’ll be packing out Thekla for the occasions. It is called The Water, after all. So why not take in The Water from a boat stubbornly fixed to the side of Bristol with concrete? Grab a ticket and get down to the harbour side on the 7th and enjoy the indie waves breaking over you.
