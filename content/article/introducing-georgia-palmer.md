Georgia Palmer is a Devon-based singer-songwriter with a beautiful voice and unforgettable stage presence. Fans will be happy to know that 2016 will see the release of her first solo album, recorded and produced by herself and filled with original songs.

Georgia has been immersed in the local music scene for the past few years, gigging with various bands and touring local venues and festivals. Her focus has now turned to writing solo material, with songs inspired by the nature surrounding her, and the peace it brings. A free spirit travelling with her guitar on her back, Georgia’s music and lyrics speaks to the kindred soul, such as her recently released single, Mother Show Me – a soft, haunting track with layered guitars and harmonies.

Masterful with both her instruments and her words, Georgia Palmer is certainly one to follow (which can be done [here](https://www.facebook.com/georgiapalmermusic/timeline)).
