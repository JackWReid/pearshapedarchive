This November Marika Hackman is bringing her dreamy, ethereal music to Bristol’s Thekla in a night of music not to be missed.

Marika Hackman is a star on the rise. Following in the footsteps of Pearshaped-favourite (and her musical mentor) Laura Marling, she is simultaneously reinventing and making a name for herself in the indie/folk scene. This year we’ve seen the release of her second studio album, I’m Not Your Man, and she has recently returned from a U.S. tour with The Big Moon (who also featured as her band in the album recording). Now, she’s back in the U.K. for a headline tour.

Originally named a folk sweetheart, this new album marks a change in her musical career. It veers towards a less clean-cut, heavier sound. Hackman has [explained](http://diymag.com/2017/06/02/marika-hackman-im-not-your-man-interview-june-2017) that whilst this change is partly natural and due to a progression in her sound, it’s largely a result of confidence. She stated recently that the lyrics came from a place of bravery and empowerment. 

I for one cannot wait to see a night of punky girl-power music brought to the stage by one of the most exciting artists around in one of Bristol’s coolest venues.
