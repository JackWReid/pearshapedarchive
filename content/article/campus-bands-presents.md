The Allergens are in their third year as a group, and yet their growth still seems exponential. Having released five E.P.s this year, the iconoclastic band show no signs of slowing down, pumping out their Charly Bliss and Magnetic Fields indebted music at a ridiculous rate – and somehow keeping matching the quantity with quality. Their inventive guitar work, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and sheer energy are a perfect mix.

Cantaloupe Island are the creation of student Ciaran Austin, and another band very much on the rise. Both their covers (American Boy being a particular favourite of mine) and their originals are tight as can be, and are sure to get you dancing. If the copious saxophone parts don’t entice you, I’m not sure what will.

Psychopomp won Exeter’s very own Battle of the Bands competition in 2017, beating some fantastic groups in the final (The Allergens included). They’ve since played a host of high profile gigs, including the inaugural Exefest. Playing an indescribable mix of psych-rock and indie, these guys are sure to wow you with their varied time signatures and wonderful melodies – not to mention covers that often blow the original band’s version out of the water.

I would go out of my way to see any one of these bands play, so to catch all three in one night at probably the finest venue in Exeter is an absolute treat. See you there!
