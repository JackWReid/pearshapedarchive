Wand, hailing from LA, have released four of the greatest psychedelic rock albums of recent times. They regularly draw comparisons with peers such as Ty Segall, who they have toured with previously, and Thee Oh Sees. Much like these bands, catching them in a live setting is essential.

In September of this year, Wand released their fourth studio album, Plum, a diverse record with unexpected influences ranging from Pink Floyd to early Radiohead. It also happens to be their best album yet. Even though earlier releases Golem, 1000 days and Ganglion Reef are excellent albums in their own right, on Plum Wand seem to have truly hit their stride. Across 10 tracks the band have carved out their own unique sound, but still manage to balance it with the intensity that made the earlier records so exciting.

Whilst the albums are of the highest quality, Wand are a band best experienced live. It will certainly be interesting to see their older, more hard-hitting material intertwined with some of the more delicate and thoughtful offerings from Plum.

Wand play Bristolâ€™s intimate The Louisiana on Thursday 25th January, and the chance to hear one of the best psychedelic rock albums of the year in such a small venue is an opportunity not to be missed.
