Marmozets are an incredibly dynamic band playing exquisitely crafted raucous alternative rock. The Northern rockers return to Exeter this May, playing at our beloved Lemmy as part of a tour to promote new album Knowing What You Know Now which was released this January. It’s the band’s second full-length offering, and while it is packed with the usual Marmozets raw energy that is guaranteed to slay in a live setting, it also documents a progression in the band’s sound, from incredibly high vocals and a horn section in killer single Major System Error to the eerily indulgent Insomnia.

The UK leg of this tour will come after a round of dates in the US, and will be followed up by an impressive string of festival appearances across Europe. Marmozets are a riot in the best of ways, and this gig will be great for some pre- or mid-exam stress release. See you in the mosh pit.
