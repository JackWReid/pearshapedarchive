The name of the band means “aliens” in Welsh – which is appropriate, as Estrons transcend any earthly expectations of conventional genre as they fuse punk, indie and alternative rock to bring a savage sound that has already gained exposure from Radio Wales, XFM and Radio 1. Their upcoming single Make A Man is loud, punchy and headbangingly brilliant. Lead singer Taliesyn Källström’s powerful vocals snarl in true punk fashion as drums and guitars vie for frontline status in an enthralling whirl that shows the band’s penchant for hard-hitting and memorable choruses. Welsh language C-C-Cariad! is another hit that follows the same blueprint, as is My Turn.

Whether Estrons follow the Super Furry Animals’ lead in bringing Welsh language rock to the mainstream is another matter, as their debut EP looks likely to include an exciting new selection of English language songs. However, there is almost an inevitability of Estrons exploding onto the scene in the near future – they’re too good not to.
