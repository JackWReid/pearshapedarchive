Following the release of their much anticipated seventh studio album Little Fictions at the start of February; Elbow embark on their most extensive UK tour since 2009. Alongside bands such as Coldplay, Elbow are one of the most successful ‘millennial’ bands that have hung around for the long-haul sticking to a simple formula of dramatic rock songs with sweeping orchestration and subtle lyrics.

With hits such as the triumphantly uplifting One Day Like This and Grounds for Divorce, Elbow’s live performance have previously been regarded as a “triumph of steady charm” by The Guardian. Support comes from the highly regarded, Mercury nominated artist C Duncan who channels a similar rock-orchestral vibe to that of Elbow.

The tour already boasts four sold-out dates at Manchester’s O2 Apollo, whilst also selling out shows in London, Birmingham & Edinburgh, the band are also setting foot further afield at venues in Doncaster and Bridlington. With limited tickets still available for their date at Plymouth Pavilions for £38.55 this is not one to be missed!
