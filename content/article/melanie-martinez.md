The British audience are continuously looking for something a little more quaint, so here’s an interesting one for you: Melanie Martinez’s concept album Crybaby - which contains the gold-certified single Dollhouse - is now gold in its own right. Not too bad for an artist whose career started as an audition on NBC’s The Voice - whilst she was still in high school, I must mention. 

Martinez makes artsy, individual and highly-stylized music which has axiomatically struck a chord with a large audience in her native country, The United States of America. The vast majority of her lyrics are based on her songs’ titles – such as the aforementioned Dollhouse, for example.  The ominous Crybaby is predominantly told from the first person perspective of the character, Cry Baby, who plays as a fantasy depiction of Martinez’s younger years. Some of the undertones in the concept album are extremely dark and contain adult themes which complement the ominous sound being conveyed; written by Melanie herself. She also has a fantastic voice.

With 3,284,457 monthly listeners on Spotify currently, there’s no doubt that the figure is only going to increase as she visits the UK to play several shows - with many of the dates selling out almost instantenously. The most notable of those for us in the South West is the 02 Academy in Bristol on the 25th November. I have no doubt Martinez’s maverick appeal and grandiloquent song-writing ability is enough for you to become immersed into.
