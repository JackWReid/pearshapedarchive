Alternative rock band Deaf Havana from Norfolk formed in 2005 and have since made a significant mark on the alt-rock scene, evident in their older hits such as The Past Six Years reaching over 2 million listens on Spotify. With their eclectic combination of indie inspired lyrics tied with rock riffs, it’s not surprising they took the music scene by storm. Their recent releases maintain their signature style with anthems such as Sing and a more laid back indie/pop-punk track, St Paul's. There is already a clear diverse direction for their new album, which I feel is one of the most important attributes of a good album. Rivals such as Don Broco have just had a very successful 2016, making it even more exciting to see what Deaf Havana have up their sleeve. They will be playing Bristol’s O2 Academy on the 2nd February 2017. If you’re around the area and free at the time, I would 100% recommend grabbing yourself and some friends a couple of tickets. It's looking to be a great line up with Deaf Havana flying the flag for heavy alt-rock once again.
