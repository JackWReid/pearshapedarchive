There are three things I definitely know about Kate Tempest. One, she is a woman of many talents; being not only an award-winning poet but an author and rapper as well. Two, she hails all the way from South London. And three, she’s back with a tour this December!

The tour is in support of her new record Let Them Eat Chaos (out October 7th) which follows her critically acclaimed, Mercury Prize nominated debut album Everybody Down. Tempest’s debut album tells the story of three characters navigating through different nuances of life and trying to get by in the world. The journey continues for these characters within Tempest’s debut novel The Bricks That Built the Houses which was published earlier this year.

With Let Them Eat Chaos close on the horizon, an album trailer was recently released on YouTube which gave fans a preview of her sophomore album. The trailer features the title track Picture A Vacuum which provides a powerful commentary on the current chaotic state of the world. This hints towards a very politically charged album which will be great to listen to while we think about the absolute shambles that 2016 has been. Not all bad though, given you can ponder upon these thoughts with the Tempest herself at O2 Academy Bristol on the 8th of December. Her commanding lyricism and sound is bound to create waves, so this is definitely not a gig you would want to miss.
