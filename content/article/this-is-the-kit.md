This summer while working at a festival I had a free afternoon. The sun was shining for the first time in a couple of days, and so I headed to the main stage just to see what was going on. Fortunately, I happened to catch This Is The Kit’s main stage performance and was blown away. Whilst sat in the sun with a cider in my hand, the alt-folk workings of Stables flowed through the air, and I knew immediately that they had a new fan.

Female fronted bands seem to be on the rise on the UK music scene, and I for one couldn’t be happier. This Is The Kit is a ten year long musical project of Bristol-born, Paris-based musician Kate Stables. With her fourth album, Moonshine Freeze, having come out this summer (and being celebrated as Rough Trade’s album of the month), produced by PJ Harvey’s John Parish, and a tour later this year supporting The National Stables, she has established herself as quite the musical powerhouse. Furthermore, after a decade of experience and four albums under her belt Stables is a highly proficient performer, and she’s heading out on tour again.

Catch Stables and her band at Colston Hall-  Bristol’s largest concert hall and self-proclaimed heart of music- on the 7th October.
