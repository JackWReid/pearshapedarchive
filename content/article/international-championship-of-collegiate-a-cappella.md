The International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella is coming back to Exeter this year, for its South-West Quarter Finals. Organised by Varsity Vocals, this competition will put some of the best university a cappella groups in the southwest region in competition with one another for a spot in the semi-finals.

Given the significantly large a cappella society we have here at Exeter, it is no surprise that nearly half of the talented groups competing are from the university: The Bluebelles, Sweet Nothings, and Illuminations will all be there to show off their vocal skills with their catchy covers of contemporary songs. If you’re a fan of Pentatonix, Pitch Perfect, or simply anything that showcases the skill it takes to pull off entire songs with just one’s vocal chords, come along to Northcott Theatre on the 10th and enjoy the magic of a cappella live!
