Alice Jemima’s captivating music takes hold of its listener effortlessly and leaves a unique impression, as her delicate vocals pour softly over driving, rhythmic basslines. What’s so mesmerising is how she manages to create music that is simultaneously dreamlike and purposeful, expertly combining the sweet intricacy of her lyrics with punchy, compelling rhythms that weave round each other skilfully.

Alice has just recently released her EP Liquorice, which displays a stunning sense of simplicity and richness - something that is so refreshing to experience within today’s sphere of pop. The EP artfully navigates so many interesting dynamics; between originality and catchiness, space and complexity, ease and intensity – often occupying a seemingly impossible middle ground between the two. It’s all beautifully enhanced by the thoughtful contemporary electronic production.

The young singer/songwriter has been steadily rising to success over the last couple of years, having supported acts such as Kim Churchill and Lucy Rose, and performing to crowds across the UK at events including Larmer Tree Festival, Beautiful Days and Bestival. We’re lucky to have her playing here in Exeter on Thursday 27th October – this is definitely one not to miss!
