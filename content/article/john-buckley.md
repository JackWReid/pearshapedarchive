The beautiful Cornish coastline has inspired countless artists from Thomas Hardy all the way to John Buckley. Although one of those names may be more familiar than the other, reputation becomes irrelevant when you listen to Buckley’s music. His catchy, quirky guitar lead tunes will stick in your head and put a smile on your face. A personal favourite of mine, Festival, evokes sunny memories of sitting on a cliff edge looking out over the beautiful Watergate Bay listening to Buckley sing to a packed-out crowd at The View stage at Boardmasters festival.

He possesses the voice of a future star and a song writing ability sure to impress; finding a vibrant and modern way of bringing raw Cornish innocence and artistic prowess into the 21st century - amazing what one man can do with 5 strings. His music is original, his lyrics are relatable, and his melodies are catchy. A prime example of his talent can be found in his recently released single Cigarettes & Aftershave.

A local boy who started of his career posting videos on Facebook, John Buckley is bringing his first solo tour through Exeter’s very own Phoenix. The evening is sure to be an intimate event with a wonderful atmosphere decorated by a talented singer songwriter who is sure to perform a variety of his own music and maybe even some cleverly reworked covers that you can sing along to.
