**_So, how does it feel being in the final of Battle of the Bands this year?_** **Marcus:** Pretty great, the standard is really good this year. **Ben:** Yeah, it’s exciting to be on the level of guys we know are really sick so, it’s nice to be on the same stage as them! **Jake:** It’s a pleasure!

**_When did you first get together and how did your name come about?_** **Marcus:** We got together at the beginning of second year. Me and Ben had played guitar together a few times but never really got a band going until second year, that was when we met Elliot and Jake. **Jake:** Yeah it was at a Campus Bands ‘mingler’ thing and those two (Ben and Marcus) sort of flirted at me, drew me in. **Ben:** The name came about because my second-year house had a stress ball that was shaped like a cow and she was called Marmalade so we thought, this is a good name… It’s not that serious, it’s kind of funny - we started bringing her onstage with us as Marmalade and the Stress Cows but we lost her and became Stress Cows in homage. **Jake:** Rest in peace…

**_Your sound is an interesting mix of quite a lot of different influences, which artists inspired you to start playing together?_** **Marcus:** The first song I wrote was Angst Song and that was mainly based on Spoon stuff. **Ben:** I’d say my biggest influence is probably Sufjan Stevens, melody wise. **Jake:** I like Arctic Monkeys really, keeping it simple. **Elliot:** Yeah same here, bit of Libertines as well. **Jake:** Razorlight too - underappreciated.

**_You guys have been known to break out a Kanye cover at your gigs from time to time, can we expect a Yeezy track in the final?_** **Marcus:** I don’t know, we sort of debated it... **Ben:** Yeah, we were wondering whether it was just ‘done’ for Battle of the Bands but, we are kind of famed for that cover a bit. **Marcus:** It is good fun! **Jake:** Kills my f\*\*\*\*\*g arm though!

**_Which song sums up your relationship as a band?_** **Ben:** That’s a tough one… **Marcus:** Sex on Fire? **Jake:** Yeah definitely! That one night of passion…. **Marcus:** We’re not supposed to talk about that Jake!

**_Which band member would last the longest in a zombie apocalypse?_** **Elliot:** I’d die straight away! Not even from a zombie, I’d just trip over something! **Ben:** Jake I feel like you’d somehow be late for it, you’d arrive halfway through, stumble out of bed. **Jake:** I’d just sleep through it! **Ben:** Marcus and I have been mauled to death already and you’re wandering around… **Elliot:** Faceplant into a drum kit or something!

**_Any pre-show rituals before you guys go on stage?_** **Ben:** Well you guys (Jake and Marcus) just get drunk before the show! **Marcus:** Oh yeah, right beforehand! **Ben:** I stick to water because I’m worried about my voice, and I always warm up to Pinegrove. **Marcus:** I always have one pint. No more, otherwise I won’t be able to play- **Jake:** Also sugar, a lot of sugar… **Marcus:** - last time I didn’t finish my pint and when I got off I was like “oh I didn’t really play that well…” So, it’s a lucky pint!

**_Who else has impressed you so far in the competition?_** **Marcus:** Psychopomp are my favourites, love them; I’m a big Psychopomp fan, I keep going on about them at practice! **Ben:** I really like The Allergens, their lyrics especially. **Jake:** And my mate’s the guitarist with Chiara and the Vu too. **Ben:** Plus Palm Beach, they’ve got a really great style.

**_What plans for the rest of this year after Battle of the Bands?_** **Jake:** We’ve got an EP coming out that we’ve recorded and are mixing next week. **Marcus:** Should be out by the end of term! **Ben:** Also, I feel like we’ll probably be doing another EP as well; we’ve got songs we’re hopefully going to write before the final. **Marcus:** And more Firehouse gigs as well.

**_What would it mean for you to win Battle of the Bands?_** **Marcus:** Hundred and twenty quid each… **Jake:** It’s a lot of money… **Ben:** It’s all about the pride of winning rather than the money, Marcus! But no, I think it would be good to have some kind of validation. Obviously, there are people who like us because we’re in the final, but it would just be a nice validation finally to be able to go, “Yeah, we probably are kind of alright!”. **Marcus:** When you’re onstage it never sounds as good as when you watch the other bands as well. **Jake:** As one of the oldest bands too, it’d be a nice way to end it… go out with a bang!
