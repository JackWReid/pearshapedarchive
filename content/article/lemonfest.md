Having recently graced the stage of The Lemon Grove, We Are Scientists continue their self-proclaimed fetish of lemons by headlining Lemonfest in South Devon, alongside drum and bass maestro Shy FX. The two-day festival takes place from 9th\-10th June at Newton Abbot Racecourse, with camping available for Friday and Saturday night. The campsite itself boasts its own silent disco area with its own ‘late night bar’ to keep you going through the night.

Joining the headliners are an injection of dub and reggae from both Gentleman’s Dub Club and Dreadzone. The iconic Craig Charles (who’s voice you may recognise from Takeshi’s Castle and Robot Wars in your younger years) playing a ‘Funk and Soul Set’, as well as the hotly anticipated Fenech Soler. Other acts include Little Comets, Liam Bailey and Exeter locals Black Foxxes. There are still many more acts still to join the already announced ‘first-wave’ lineup.

Coming at the start of June Lemonfest is the perfect way to kick-start your summer festivities, whether you are heading home, off to Glastonbury or albeit further afield after a stressful exam period! Tickets are priced at £60 for the weekend with camping, £45 without and £27 for a day ticket. The festival is a 26 minute drive from the university or a 20 minutes train journey from St Davids, at just £3.85 for a return. Make sure you don’t miss out on Lemonfest 2017!
