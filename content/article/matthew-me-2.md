Since their debut, Matthew & Me have graced the alternative pop scene with their atmospheric calm. The South Devon duo have been playing their songs since 2013 and have been very well accommodated in the music scene with much support from BBC Introducing in Devon. In 2015, they played Glastonbury festival, and since have been playing gigs around the country. Their latest release Everyday uses distorted synth, gentle beats, and a delicate falsetto, which makes it live up to their signature ethereal vibe. Many of their tracks build up to a melodic noise, which is carefully layered with fine details in guitar, vocals and electronic effects. The musical intricacies used here really make up for a unique listening experience. Their ability to create intimate yet popular music make them a must-see live. Matthew and Me will be returning to their Devon roots this June and playing at Exeter’s very own Phoenix. The gig is on the 16th and is most definitely one not to be missed.
