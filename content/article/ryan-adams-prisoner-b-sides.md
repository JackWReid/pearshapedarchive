As any real Smiths fan will tell you, the B-side is a delicate thing. Once a convenient locale for sub-par, somehow less worthy compositions, its alternative, surreptitious use as a burial spot for hidden treasure (throughout the eighties particularly), has earned it prestige as a mystery space in music. Will the B-side charm me, or disappoint me? It’s only ever one or the other.

B-side compilations, then, have grown a reputation as being surprisingly good. Choice selections of my own would include Pixies’ Complete B-Sides, Pet Shop Boys’ Alternative, and of course, Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine’s Starry Eyed and Bollock Naked.

Ryan Adams’ Prisoner B-Sides is the latest addition to this legacy of asides. It’s seventeen songs strong, sweetly textured and very nicely produced. It complements its parent record perfectly. It _even_ introduces a few experimental flavours. Perhaps most significantly however, listeners won’t excavate any Handsome Devils here – these are B-sides in the more traditional sense.

As you might expect, the selection here is nearly-album-standard-but-not-quite. The Johnny Marr jangle outro of Stop Talking, and the urgent, post-punk minor chords of Let It Burn are highlights. Equally admirable, is the quality of Adams’ craft as a song-writer – the tunes are never really boring. End to end however, Prisoner B-Sides is, despite excellent musical performances from Adams, really rather forgettable. These are very obviously the weakest tracks from the album-proper’s sessions; without question, every one of Prisoner’s tracks out-draws these merry ‘others’. Occasionally, the compilation even strays into the objectively unwelcome – at 6:54, Too Tired to Cry is too damn long, and (for the time commitment it demands) largely uneventful. The songs also _all_ suffer from issues that began plaguing the original LP by it’s closing, thirteenth track – repetitive, cliched lyrics. Lots of loneliness, depression, regret, tears – all really good stuff, objectively, just intimidatingly plentiful here.

Sonically, this batch of music is a butterfly-print of Prisoner. Literally nothing is different, and any one of these songs might have been written and/or recorded in the same take, session, evening or week as anything on the main album. If you want to know what that sounds like, start there and with [my review](http://pearshapedexeter.com/ryan-adams-prisoner/) of the record (hint: if you haven’t heard it yet, it’s really great!).

Notably (with fans in mind), pre-orders of Prisoner: End of the World Edition (a 7” vinyl-based megabox with all kinds of additional physical tat) come with access to an extra two B-sides – The Cold and Lookout. Both do as the rest did before them – pleasantly extend proceedings whilst offering little in the way of new ideas, musically and/or otherwise. This full, nineteen-track copy of Prisoner B-Sides, when appended to the original album, draws out the run-time from forty-two minutes to an epic one hour-fifty. Unredacted, this definitive workprint copy of the album is remarkably listenable still. That said, Prisoner B-Sides will probably only hold your hold your attention if you’re a true fan of the accompanying album. It’s too obviously subordinate to those recordings to stand up on its own; and if you’re not a _major_ fan of that record, then you may find your interest waning slightly toward the end.

Put short, if you loved Prisoner like I did, Christmas has come early. If you didn’t, stick with the original thirteen songs – you’re not missing anything too different in style or ambition here… just length.
