Finding fame with London new wave icons Squeeze in the early eighties, Glenn Tilbrook would go on, with bandmate Chris Difford, to pen a number of popular hits now synonymous with the time, amongst them the fiercely playful Cool for Cats and the waltzing kitchen-sink lament, Labelled with Love. Tilbrookâ€™s sound is very particular; chords rooted in the crafted pop of the fifties, with wry nods and winks that can only have come from the dissonant soundscape of the late seventies.

His reputation as a live performer is sterling; known for cracking jokes, telling anecdotes and taking cover requests, Tillbrook is as famous for his fun antics as he is his mastery of the pop music formula.

In recent years, alongside a Squeeze revival, he has toured the US with Difford, and has, in between times, released successful solo records, with heavy airplay on BBC Radio 2 and 6. With recent set-lists boasting a selection of songs from across his career, Tillbrook is surely not one to miss.
