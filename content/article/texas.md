With more than 40 million records sold across a career spanning over 30 years, pop-rock band Texas are serious contenders for the title of Scotland’s finest musical export. Their numerous successes include eight top ten albums. This includes their most recent release Jump on Board, the band’s ninth studio album. Highlights include Lets Work It Out, the funky disco-pop lead single and the more punk influenced Tell That Girl. Continuing what is now a trend for the band, the music videos for both singles feature cameos from famous friends; Thierry Henry stars as Spiteri’s chauffeur in one, and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones’ 'The Hound’) plays the drums in the other.

Lead singer Sharlene Spiteri is renowned for delivering high-energy and commanding performances. As a result the band’s anthemic songs featuring soulful vocals are taken to another level when experienced live. It’s no surprise the 21 date UK tour, including one night at the Royal Albert Hall, is completely sold out.

The Plymouth Pavillions show concludes the tour and is bound to feature plenty of older well-known and well-loved tunes like Say What You Want, Summer Son and Inner Smile, along with newer hits. It’s sure to be a joyous celebration of another successful addition to Texas’ extensive discography.
