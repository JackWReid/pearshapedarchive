Ireland’s Lisa Hannigan, with her gentle and captivating harmonies and acoustics, performs at Bristol’s Thekla on 17th October. Discovered after singing alongside Damien Rice, who she met at a concert in Dublin early in the millennium, Hannigan’s third and latest album At Swim sees her experiment with soft, folk tones. These echo domestic contemporaries SOAK and The Cranberries, with the intimate cache of songs seeming perfect for incoming crisp, autumnal days.

Nautical by name and connotation, Lisa Hannigan’s set will feel at home as it is performed in a former cargo ship next month. With song topics ranging from love and loneliness to death and homesickness, the tracks drift across a spectrum of personal and raw emotions. These emotions are even more easily felt when heard live, as each number flows smoothly into the next.

With her Bristol stop being one of the many sold out dates on her tour, those fortunate enough to possess tickets will certainly be in for a unique night of contemporary singer-songwriter, folk talent.
