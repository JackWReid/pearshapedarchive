Deadlines getting you down? If it’s denial of impending degree-related doom you’re after, a night in Bristol next week could be the just the escape you need – and with electronic duo HONNE playing a show at the Trinity Centre on October 23rd, there’s a great opportunity to dance away your essay-based blues.

The band’s name derives from the Japanese concept of “true/innermost feelings”, a prompt that has paved the way for their music. Their debut album (released last July) was filled with romantically-driven narratives of hope and heartbreak, all set against their special brand of late-night electronica. With their slick bass-lines and vocal harmonies aplenty, HONNE have a lot to give to any fans of Jack Garratt, Oh Wonder or Jungle – they should be of interest to Izzy Bizu fans, too, as they notably collaborated with her for their track Someone That Loves You for their album (one of the strongest tracks on there).

The Bristol show marks another stop in their international tour promoting the release of their debut album, Warm On A Cold Night (they’ve already traveled extensively over the US and Canada before returning here for their UK gigs). It’s been a busy couple of months for them, really – they played a long list of festivals over the summer (Latitude, Bestival, Glastonbury…) but they’re on fantastic form and it should be a brilliant show. If this isn’t enough to whet your appetite, PearShaped recently [spoke to them](http://pearshapedexeter.com/honne/) about the release of their album. HONNE live is truly an experience not to be missed.
