Electropop singer-songwriter, Shura first broke onto the scene with the sparkling synth beats of her 2014 single, Touch. The video for Touch, which was co-directed and edited by Shura, went on to amass over 27 million views on YouTube. The song was followed with a stream of synthpop gems, such as Indecision, 2Shy and White Light. This year the Mancunian released her debut album, Nothing’s Real, which entered the charts at Number 13 in July. And this December, Shura brings her beautifully crafted sound to the Britol Trinity Centre.

As [Hope Claydon](http://pearshapedexeter.com/shura-nothings-real/) has pointed out, in the face of the robustly confident pop anthems (Take Ariana Grande & Nicki Minaj’s Side to Side, Bruno Mars’ 24K Magic or any number of pop songs) Shura offers a pop alternative for the more reserved among us. Shura’s lyrics are angst-ridden but not self-indulgent, and thoughtful without being obscure. The result is song-writing that feels personal and exceptionally relatable. Shura’s mellow vocals add to her music’s intimate and introspective feel. Meanwhile, her evident love of 80s grooves gives her music an expansiveness through its bassy undertones and effervescent synth details.

This December you have the opportunity to see Shura in all her splendour in the extraordinary venue that is the Trinity Centre. Don’t miss your chance!
