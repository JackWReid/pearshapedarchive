It’s time for Poltimore Festival once again! The non-profit festival supports artists from across the South West, blending art, music, theatre, and film into one whirlwind event in May. For the seventh year running, the festival will host numerous artists at a one day festival in a celebration of creativity. Poltimore Festival will kick things off with a launch party at the well-known indie club Cavern, located in the heart of Exeter. The launch party will feature three local bands that encapsulate the spirit of Poltimore, followed by an after party with Don’t Walk, Boogie. The event will take place on Wednesday February 7th, with doors opening at 8 pm. Early bird tickets are already sold out, but general admission tickets are available online now. Tickets will also be sold at the door.

The launch party features three main acts, each reminiscent of the local music scene in the Devon area. Natives of the thriving Bristol art scene, psychedelic pop band Cousin Kula is headlining the launch party. They have become known for their rolling basslines and striking vocals. Their first EP, Oodles, was only released this past December, but in the month since Cousin Kula have been thrilling fans old and new.

Opening for Cousin Kula is Exeter-based group Pattern Pusher, described as “electric synth-pop art-rock”. They are returning for yet another year with Poltimore, riding the wave of their first EP, P.S. The debut EP was recorded locally in bedrooms and lounges in the Devon area.

The third band performing at the Poltimore Festival launch party is Psychopomp, a student band hailing from Exeter itself. They have won the University’s Battle of the Bands, establishing themselves in the local music scene. This year marks their second year with Poltimore and are sure to captivate audiences with their dramatic vocals and art-rock beats.

The performances will be followed by an after party with Don’t Walk, Boogie, Exeter’s local funk, soul, and disco DJ group. For both fans and newcomers to Poltimore Festival, Wednesday’s launch party is sure to be a musical highlight of the term.
