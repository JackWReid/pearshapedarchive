Re-e-wind to September 2015, Craig David had been out of the scene for seven years and, following the release of his Greatest Hits, mockumentary crew Kurupt FM are performing a Sixty Minutes Take Over live on Radio 1 Extra. The crew’s DJ Beats gets a call from his son, and goes to collect him from the car park. On his return it’s not his son but the legendary Craig David himself who launches into a mix of his hit Fill Me In with Justin Bieber’s Where R U Now? The video went viral overnight.

The rest is simply history. He had a summer-long residency at Ibiza Rocks Hotel, performed at the X-Factor final and even played an unannounced set at Notting Hill Carnival – which, from personal experience, was an incredible moment. His astounding comeback year culminated with the release of his sixth studio album Following My Intuition and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. What a year.

Craig David now embarks on a UK tour, covering his homeland from tip to toe and has even managed to sell out the date at The O2 Arena, London. Support comes from Big Narstie and Lauren Faith, so expect some duets throughout his set. Don’t miss out on tickets – it’s going to be a good one.
