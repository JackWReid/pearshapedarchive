If you were a fan of indie music in your teenage years, you'll surely have been a fan of Bombay Bicycle Club and will have been disappointed that, following a successful four album strong career, the band decided to take a hiatus last year. However, fortunately for us, we were not kept waiting long for a return and this time former frontman Jack Steadman is trying it solo. Moving away from his indie roots and working towards a sound full of soul, funk and R&B Steadman has just released his debut solo album, God First, and is now embarking on a tour across the UK. The album is a Mark Ronson-esque dive into music curation and production, with Steadman taking a back seat vocally and relying instead on guest vocalists and samples. The range of vocalists and performers may make this an interesting album to perform live and it's with intrigue that I anticipate the tour. Catch Mr Jukes in Bristol's Marble Factory during Freshers Week, on September 19th. In what claims to be Bristol's newest venue and is billed a former skate park, this is a night of music and ambience not to be missed.
