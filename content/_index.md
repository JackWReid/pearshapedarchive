PearShaped Magazine was a music magazine founded at the University of Exeter in 2013. Its aim was to promote local live music and to provide a venue for students making their first steps in music journalism. It ran for six years before publishing its final article in 2019.

The magazine was run by a committee of volunteers who acted as editors and more. Over a hundred students wrote thousands of articles for the magazine over the years. This archive ensures that while their work isn't lost.
